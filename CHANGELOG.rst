Changed
-------

- Evolved pass-based transpiler to support advanced functionality (#1060)
- `.retrieve_job()` and `.jobs()` no longer returns results by default,
  instead the result must be accessed by the `result()` method on the job
  objects (#1082).
- Make `backend.status()` dictionary conform with schema.
- The different output backends for the circuit_drawer() visualizations
  have been moved into separate private modules in
  `qiskit.tools.visualizations`. (#1105, #1111)
- DAG nodes contain pointers to Register and Instruction objects, rather
  than their string names (#1189).
- Upgraded some external dependencies to:
   -  networkx>=2.2 (#1267).
- The `qiskit.tools.visualization.circuit_drawer()` method now returns
  a matplotlib.Figure object when the `mpl` output is used and a
  `TextDrawer` object when `text` output is used. (#1224, #1181)
- Speed up the Pauli class and extended its operators (#1271 #1166).
- `IBMQ.save_account()` now takes an `overwrite` option to replace an existing
  account on disk. Default is False (#1295).
- Backend and Provider methods defined in the specification use model objects
  rather than dicts, along with validation against schemas (#1249, #1277,
  #1350). The updated methods include:
  - ``backend.status()`` (#1301).
  - ``backend.configuration()`` (and ``__init__``) (#1323).
  - ``backend.properties()``, returning ``None`` for sims (#1331, #1401).
  - ``qiskit.Result`` (#1360).
- ``backend.provider()`` is now a method instead of a property (#1312).
- Remove local backend (Aer) fallback (#1303)
- The signatures for the plotting functions in
  `qiskit.tools.visualization._counts_visualization.py`,
  `qiskit.tools.visualization._state_visualization.py`, and
  `qiskit.tools.visualization.interactive` have been modified to make them
  in-line with standard Matplotlib calling conventions (#1359).
- Remove local backend (Aer) fallback (#1303).
- DAGCircuits store Instruction and Register objects, instead of name
  references. The DAGCircuit class methods are updated accordingly (#1210).
- ``transpile()`` now takes QuantumCircuit(s) to QuantumCircuit(s), and DAG
  processing is only done internally (#1397).
- The different unrollers are deprecated. The only unrolling happens
  from DAG to DAG (#1210).
- Moved all the circuit modules into a circuit module but for most users it
  is still imported in the top level for QuantumCircuit, QuantumRegister,
  ClassicalRegister
- ``qiskit.backends`` has been renamed to ``qiskit.providers`` (#1531).
- ``qiskit.backends.aer`` has been removed in favor of
  ``qiskit.providers.builtinsimulators`` (Python simulators) and
  ``qiskit.providers.legacysimulators`` (C++ simulators) (#1484)
- ``Aer`` in ``qiskit`` root module depends on having the
  qiskit-aer package installed, by default it is not present. Instead there are
  2 new provider instances in the root module ``BasicAer`` which provides the
  Python simulators and ``LegacySimulators`` which provides the old C++
  simulators in qiskit-terra. (#1484)


Deprecated
----------

- ``plot_circuit()``, ``latex_circuit_drawer()``, ``generate_latex_source()``,
   and ``matplotlib_circuit_drawer()`` from qiskit.tools.visualization are
   deprecated. Instead the ``circuit_drawer()`` function from the same module
   should be used. (#1055)
- The current default output of ``circuit_drawer()`` (using latex and falling
   back on python) is deprecated and will be changed in the future. (#1055)
- The `qiskit.wrapper.load_qasm_string()` and `qiskit.wrapper.load_qasm_file()`
  functions are deprecated and the `QuantumCircuit.from_qasm_str()` and
  `QuantumCircuit.from_qasm_file()` contstructor methods should be used instead
  (#1172)
- The ``plot_barriers`` and ``reverse_bits`` keys in the ``style`` kwarg dict
  are deprecated, instead the `qiskit.tools.visualization.circuit_drawer()`
  kwargs ``plot_barriers`` and ``reverse_bits`` should be used instead. (#1180)
- The ``transpile_dag()`` function ``format`` kwarg for emitting different
  output formats is deprecated (#1319).
- Several methods of ``qiskit.Result`` have been deprecated (#1360).
- The functions `plot_state()` and `iplot_state()` have been depreciated.
  Instead the functions `plot_state_*()` and `iplot_state_*()` should be
  called. (#1359)
- The ``skip_transpiler`` arg has been deprecated from ``compile()`` and
  ``execute()`` in favor of using the PassManager directly.

Fixed
-----

- Fixed a variety of typos throughout sources (#1139)
- Fixed horizontal spacing when drawing barriers before CCNOT gates in latex
  circuit plots (#1051)
- Use case insensitive matching when comparing premium account URLs. (#1102)

  AerJob usage (#1125)
- Fixed an edge case when connection checks would raise an unhandled exception
  (#1226)
- Fixed a bug where the transpiler moved middle-of-circuit measurements to the
  end (#1334)
- The `number_to_keep` kwarg in ``plot_histgram()`` now functions correctly
  (#1359).
- parallel_map no longer creates a progress bar for a single circuit (#1394).
- The `timeout` parameter is now passed into the inner ``_wait_for_submission``
  function in ``IBMQJob`` from ``_wait_for_result`` (#1542).

Removed
-------

- Remove register, available_backends (#1131).
- Remove tools/apps (#1184).
- Removed the dependency on ``IBMQuantumExperience``, as it is now included
  in ``qiskit.backends.IBMQ`` (#1198).
- ``matplotlib`` is no longer in the package requirements and is now an
  optional dependency. In order to use any matplotlib based visualizations
  (which includes the ``qiskit.tools.visualization.circuit_drawer()``
  ``mpl`` output,
  ``qiskit.tools.visualization.plot_state``,
  ``qiskit.tools.visualization.plot_histogram``, and
  ``qiskit.tools.visualization.plot_bloch_vector`` you will now need to ensure
  you manually install and configure matplotlib independently.
- The ``basis`` kwarg for the ``circuit_drawer()`` function to provide an
  alternative list of basis gates has been removed. Instead users should adjust
  the basis gates prior to visualizing the circuit. (#1151)
- ``backend.parameters()`` and ``backend.calibration()`` have been fully
  deprecated, in favour of ``backend.properties()`` (#1305).
- The ``qiskit.tools.file_io`` module has been removed. Conversion between
  ``qiskit.Result`` and json can be achieved using ``.to_dict()`` and
  ``.from_dict()`` directly (#1360).
- The ``qiskit.Result`` class method for ``len()`` and indexing have been
  removed, along with the functions that perform post-processing (#1351).
- The ``get_snapshot()`` and ``get_snapshots()`` method from the ``Result``
  class has been removed. Instead you can access the snapshots in a Result
  using ``Result.data()['snapshots']``.
- Completed the deprecation of ``job.backend_name()``, ``job.id()``, and the
  ``backend_name`` parameter in its constructor.
- The ``qiskit.Result`` class now does post-processing of results returned
  from backends if they are called via the ``Result.get_xxx()`` methods
  (i.e. ``get_counts()``, ``get_memory()``, ``get_statevector()``,
  ``get_unitary()``). The raw data is accessible through ``Result.data()``
  (#1404).
- The ``transpile()`` function kwarg ``format`` has been removed and will
  always return a circuit object. Instead you'll need to manually convert the
  output with the functions provided in ``qiskit.converters``.

=====================


Improvements
------------

- Introduce providers and rework backends (#376).

    - Introduce convenience wrapper functions around commonly used Qiskit
      components (e.g. ``compile`` and ``execute`` functions).
    - Introduce the DefaultQISKitProvider, which acts as a context manager for
      the current session (e.g. providing easy access to all
      ``available_backends``).
    - Avoid relying on QuantumProgram (eventual deprecation).
    - The functions are also available as top-level functions (for example,
      ``qiskit.get_backend()``).

      ``local_statevector_simulator_cpp``.
    - Introduce aliased and deprecated backend names and mechanisms for
      resolving them.
    - Introduce optional ``compact`` flag to query backend names only by unique
      function.

  during #403)
- Fix ability to apply all gates on register (#369)


Deprecated
----------

- Some methods of ``QuantumProgram`` are soon to be deprecated. Please use the
  top-level functions instead.
- The ``Register`` instantiation now expects ``size, name``. Using
  ``name, size`` is still supported but will be deprecated in the future.

  use the ``local_statevector_simulator``, or explicitly ask for ``snapshot``.
- Return ``job`` instance after ``run()``, rather than ``result``.
- Rename simulators according to
  ``PROVIDERNAME_SIMPLEALIAS_simulator_LANGUAGEORPROJECT``
- Move simulator extensions to ``qiskit/extensions/simulator``

Changed
-------

- The standard extension for creating U base gates has been modified to be
  consistent with the rest of the gate APIs (see #203).


Removed
-------

- The ``silent`` parameter has been removed from a number of ``QuantumProgram``
  methods. The same behaviour can be achieved now by using the
  ``enable_logs()`` and ``disable_logs()`` methods, which use the standard
  Python logging.


Fixed
-----

- Fix basis gates (#76).
- Enable QASM parser to work in multiuser environments.
- Correct operator precedence when parsing expressions (#190).
- Fix "math domain error" in mapping (#111, #151).
