# configure `setuptools-rust`, because we do a little dynamic trick with the debug setting, and we
# also want an explicit `setup.py` file to exist so we can manually call
#
#   python setup.py build_rust --inplace --release
#
# to make optimized Rust components even for editable releases, which would otherwise be quite
# unergonomic to do otherwise.


# Check for a default build profile from the environment (`--release` or `--debug` flags to
# `build_rust` override this default).  If not present, we also check if `RUST_DEBUG=1` for
# convenience, since we did that (undocumented) until Qiskit 2.4.
