# Most of this configuration is managed by `pyproject.toml`.  This only includes the extra bits to
# configure `setuptools-rust`, because we do a little dynamic trick with the debug setting, and we
# also want an explicit `setup.py` file to exist so we can manually call
#
#   python setup.py build_rust --inplace --release
#
# to make optimised Rust components even for editable releases, which would otherwise be quite
# unergonomic to do otherwise.


# If RUST_DEBUG is set, force compiling in debug mode. Else, use the default behavior of whether
# it's an editable installation.
