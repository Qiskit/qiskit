    """Pulse gate adding pass.

    This pass adds gate calibrations from the supplied ``InstructionScheduleMap``
    to a quantum circuit.

    This pass checks each DAG circuit node and acquires a corresponding schedule from
    the instruction schedule map object that may be provided by the target backend.
    Because this map is a mutable object, the end-user can provide a configured backend to
    execute the circuit with customized gate implementations.

    This mapping object returns a schedule with "publisher" metadata which is an integer Enum
    value representing who created the gate schedule.
    If the gate schedule is provided by end-users, this pass attaches the schedule to
    the DAG circuit as a calibration.

    This pass allows users to easily override quantum circuit with custom gate definitions
    without directly dealing with those schedules.
