    Deprecated: Converters take an Operator and return a new Operator, generally isomorphic
    in some way with the first, but with certain desired properties. For example,
    a converter may accept ``CircuitOp`` and return a ``SummedOp`` of
    ``PauliOps`` representing the circuit unitary. Converters may not
    have polynomial space or time scaling in their operations. On the contrary, many
    converters, such as a ``MatrixExpectation`` or ``MatrixEvolution``, which convert
    ``PauliOps`` to ``MatrixOps`` internally, will require time or space exponential
    in the number of qubits unless a clever trick is known (such as the use of sparse
    matrices)."""
