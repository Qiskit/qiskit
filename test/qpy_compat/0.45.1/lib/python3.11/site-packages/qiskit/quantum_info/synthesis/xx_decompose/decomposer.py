    A class for optimal decomposition of 2-qubit unitaries into 2-qubit basis gates of XX type

    Args:
        basis_fidelity: available strengths and fidelity of each.
            Can be either (1) a dictionary mapping XX angle values to fidelity at that angle; or
            (2) a single float f, interpreted as {pi: f, pi/2: f/2, pi/3: f/3}.
        euler_basis: Basis string provided to OneQubitEulerDecomposer for 1Q synthesis.
            Defaults to "U".
        embodiments: A dictionary mapping interaction strengths alpha to native circuits which
            embody the gate CAN(alpha, 0, 0). Strengths are taken so that pi/2 represents the class
            of a full CX.

            has no efficient decomposition of its own. Useful for special cases involving 2 or 3
