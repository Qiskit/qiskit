GNU MPC is a complex floating-point library with exact rounding.
It is based on the GNU MPFR floating-point library (http://www.mpfr.org/),
which is itself based on the GNU MP library (http://gmplib.org/).

==============================FLINT2============================================

FLINT (Fast Library for Number Theory) is a C library in support of computations
in number theory. It's also a research project into algorithms in number theory.

FLINT 2 is a complete rewrite of the FLINT library from scratch. It includes
much cleaner code and in many cases much faster algorithms and implementations.

At this stage FLINT consists mainly of fast integer and polynomial
arithmetic and linear algebra. In the future it is planned that FLINT will
contain algorithms for algebraic number theory and other number theoretic
functionality.

Why pthreads-win32 did not use the GNU General Public License

-------------------------------------------------------------


    The goal of the pthreads-win32 project has been to

    provide a quality and complete implementation of the POSIX

    threads API for Microsoft Windows within the limits imposed

    by virtue of it being a stand-alone library and not

    linked directly to other POSIX compliant libraries. For

    example, some functions and features, such as those based

    on POSIX signals, are missing.


    Pthreads-win32 is a library, available in several different

    versions depending on supported compilers, and may be used

    as a dynamically linked module or a statically linked set of

    binary modules. It is not an application on it's own.


    It was fully intended that pthreads-win32 be usable with

    commercial software not covered by either the GPL or the LGPL

    licenses. Pthreads-win32 has many contributors to it's

    code base, many of whom have done so because they have

    used the library in commercial or proprietry software

    projects.


    Releasing pthreads-win32 under the LGPL ensures that the

    library can be used widely, while at the same time ensures

    that bug fixes and improvements to the pthreads-win32 code

    itself is returned to benefit all current and future users

    of the library.


    Although pthreads-win32 makes it possible for applications

    that use POSIX threads to be ported to Win32 platforms, the

    broader goal of the project is to encourage the use of open

    standards, and in particular, to make it just a little easier

    for developers writing Win32 applications to consider

    widening the potential market for their products.
