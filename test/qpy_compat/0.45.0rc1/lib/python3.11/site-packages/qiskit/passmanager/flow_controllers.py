class FlowController(BaseController):
    """A legacy factory for other flow controllers.

    .. warning::

        This class is primarily for compatibility with legacy versions of Qiskit, and in general,
        you should prefer simply instantiating the controller you want, and adding it to the
        relevant :class:`.PassManager` or other controller.  Its use is deprecated.

    This allows syntactic sugar for writing pipelines. For example::

        FlowController.add_flow_controller("my_condition", CustomController)

        controller = FlowController.controller_factory(
            [PassA(), PassB()],
            {"max_iteration": 1000},
            condition=lambda prop_set: prop_set["x"] == 0,
            do_while=lambda prop_set: prop_set["x"] < 100,
            my_condition=lambda prop_set: prop_set["y"] = "abc",
        )

    This creates a nested flow controller that runs when the value :code:`x` in the
    :class:`.PropertySet` is zero and repeats the pipeline until the value becomes 100.
    In each innermost loop, the custom iteration condition provided by
    the ``CustomController`` is also evaluated.

    .. warning::

        :class:`.BaseController` must be directly subclassed to define a custom flow controller.
        This class provides a controller factory method, which consumes a class variable
        :attr:`.registered_controllers`. Subclassing FlowController may cause
        unexpected behavior in the factory method.
        Note that factory method implicitly determines the priority of the builtin controllers
        when multiple controllers are called together,
        and the behavior of generated controller is hardly debugged.
