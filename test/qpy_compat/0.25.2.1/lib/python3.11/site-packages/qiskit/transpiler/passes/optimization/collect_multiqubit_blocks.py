    max_block_size specifies the maximum number of qubits that can be acted upon

    Traverse the DAG and find blocks of gates that act consecutively on
    groups of qubits. Write the blocks to propert_set as a list of blocks
    of the form::

    of operands is greater than max_block_size)

    gates are processed. This data structure points each qubit to a set at all
    times and the sets correspond to current blocks. These change over time
    and the data structure allows these changes to be done quickly.
