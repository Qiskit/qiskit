class VBERippleCarryAdder(Adder):
    r"""The VBE ripple carry adder [1].

    This circuit performs inplace addition of two equally-sized quantum registers.
    As an example, a classical adder circuit that performs full addition (i.e. including
    a carry-in bit) on two 2-qubit sized registers is as follows:

    Here *Carry* and *Sum* gates correspond to the gates introduced in [1].
    *Carry_dg* correspond to the inverse of the *Carry* gate. Note that
    in this implementation the input register qubits are ordered as all qubits from
    the first input register, followed by all qubits from the second input register.
    This is different ordering as compared to Figure 2 in [1], which leads to a different
    drawing of the circuit.

    .. seealso::

        The following generic gate objects perform additions, like this circuit class,
        but allow the compiler to select the optimal decomposition based on the context.
        Specific implementations can be set via the :class:`.HLSConfig`, e.g. this circuit
        can be chosen via ``Adder=["ripple_v95"]``.

        :class:`.ModularAdderGate`: A generic inplace adder, modulo :math:`2^n`. This
            is functionally equivalent to ``kind="fixed"``.

        :class:`.AdderGate`: A generic inplace adder. This
            is functionally equivalent to ``kind="half"``.

        :class:`.FullAdderGate`: A generic inplace adder, with a carry-in bit. This
            is functionally equivalent to ``kind="full"``.
