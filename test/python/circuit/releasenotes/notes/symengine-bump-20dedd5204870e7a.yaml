    The minimum version of syengine required for installing has been increased
    to 0.8.0. This was neccessary to fix some issues with the handling of
    ``numpy.float16`` and ``numpy.float32`` values when running
    :meth:`qiskit.circuit.ParameterExpression.bind` to bind parameters in a
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.ParameterExpression`.
