**Qiskit**  is an open-source SDK for working with quantum computers at the level of extended quantum circuits, operators, and primitives.

This library is the core component of Qiskit, which contains the building blocks for creating and working with quantum circuits, quantum operators, and primitive functions (Sampler and Estimator).
It also contains a transpiler that supports optimizing quantum circuits, and a quantum information toolbox for creating advanced operators.

For more details on how to use Qiskit, refer to the documentation located here:

<https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/>


## Installation

> [!WARNING]
> Do not try to upgrade an existing Qiskit 0.* environment to Qiskit 1.0 in-place. [Read more](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/migration-guides/qiskit-1.0-installation).

We encourage installing Qiskit via ``pip``:

```bash
pip install qiskit
```

Pip will handle all dependencies automatically and you will always install the latest (and well-tested) version.

To install from source, follow the instructions in the [documentation](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/guides/install-qiskit-source).

## Create your first quantum program in Qiskit

Now that Qiskit is installed, it's time to begin working with Qiskit. The essential parts of a quantum program are:
1. Define and build a quantum circuit that represents the quantum state
2. Define the classical output by measurements or a set of observable operators
3. Depending on the output, use the primitive function `sampler` to sample outcomes or the `estimator` to estimate values.

Create an example quantum circuit using the `QuantumCircuit` class:

```python
import numpy as np
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit

# 1. A quantum circuit for preparing the quantum state |000> + i |111>
qc_example = QuantumCircuit(3)
qc_example.h(0)          # generate superpostion
qc_example.p(np.pi/2,0)  # add quantum phase
qc_example.cx(0,1)       # 0th-qubit-Controlled-NOT gate on 1st qubit
qc_example.cx(0,2)       # 0th-qubit-Controlled-NOT gate on 2nd qubit
```

This simple example makes an entangled state known as a [GHZ state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenberger%E2%80%93Horne%E2%80%93Zeilinger_state) $(|000\rangle + i|111\rangle)/\sqrt{2}$. It uses the standard quantum gates: Hadamard gate (`h`), Phase gate (`p`), and CNOT gate (`cx`). 

Once you've made your first quantum circuit, choose which primitive function you will use. Starting with `sampler`,
we use `measure_all(inplace=False)` to get a copy of the circuit in which all the qubits are measured:

```python
# 2. Add the classical output in the form of measurement of all qubits
qc_measured = qc_example.measure_all(inplace=False)

# 3. Execute using the Sampler primitive
from qiskit.primitives.sampler import Sampler
sampler = Sampler()
job = sampler.run(qc_measured, shots=1000)
result = job.result()
print(f" > Quasi probability distribution: {result.quasi_dists}")
```
Running this will give an outcome similar to `{0: 0.497, 7: 0.503}` which is `000` 50% of the time and `111` 50% of the time up to statistical fluctuations.
To illustrate the power of Estimator, we now use the quantum information toolbox to create the operator $XXY+XYX+YXX-YYY$ and pass it to the `run()` function, along with our quantum circuit. Note the Estimator requires a circuit _**without**_ measurement, so we use the `qc_example` circuit we created earlier.

```python
# 2. Define the observable to be measured 
from qiskit.quantum_info import SparsePauliOp
operator = SparsePauliOp.from_list([("XXY", 1), ("XYX", 1), ("YXX", 1), ("YYY", -1)])

# 3. Execute using the Estimator primitive
from qiskit.primitives import Estimator
estimator = Estimator()
job = estimator.run(qc_example, operator, shots=1000)
result = job.result()
print(f" > Expectation values: {result.values}")
```

Running this will give the outcome `4`. For fun, try to assign a value of +/- 1 to each single-qubit operator X and Y 
and see if you can achieve this outcome. (Spoiler alert: this is not possible!)

Using the Qiskit-provided `qiskit.primitives.Sampler` and `qiskit.primitives.Estimator` will not take you very far.
The power of quantum computing cannot be simulated on classical computers and you need to use real quantum hardware to scale to larger quantum circuits.
However, running a quantum circuit on hardware requires rewriting to the basis gates and connectivity of the quantum hardware.
The tool that does this is the [transpiler](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit/transpiler), and Qiskit includes transpiler passes for synthesis, optimization, mapping, and scheduling.
However, it also includes a default compiler, which works very well in most examples.
The following code will map the example circuit to the `basis_gates = ['cz', 'sx', 'rz']` and a linear chain of qubits $0 \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow 2$ with the `coupling_map =[[0, 1], [1, 2]]`.

```python
from qiskit import transpile
qc_transpiled = transpile(qc_example, basis_gates = ['cz', 'sx', 'rz'], coupling_map =[[0, 1], [1, 2]] , optimization_level=3)
```

### Executing your code on real quantum hardware

Qiskit provides an abstraction layer that lets users run quantum circuits on hardware from any vendor that provides a compatible interface. 
The best way to use Qiskit is with a runtime environment that provides optimized implementations of `sampler` and `estimator` for a given hardware platform. This runtime may involve using pre- and post-processing, such as optimized transpiler passes with error suppression, error mitigation, and, eventually, error correction built in. A runtime implements `qiskit.primitives.BaseSampler` and `qiskit.primitives.BaseEstimator` interfaces. For example,
some packages that provide implementations of a runtime primitive implementation are:

* https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-runtime

Qiskit also provides a lower-level abstract interface for describing quantum backends. This interface, located in
``qiskit.providers``, defines an abstract `BackendV2` class that providers can implement to represent their
hardware or simulators to Qiskit. The backend class includes a common interface for executing circuits on the backends; however, in this interface each provider may perform different types of pre- and post-processing and return outcomes that are vendor-defined. Some examples of published provider packages that interface with real hardware are:

* https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-ionq
* https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-aqt-provider
* https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-braket-provider
* https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-quantinuum-provider
* https://github.com/rigetti/qiskit-rigetti

<!-- This is not an exhaustive list, and if you maintain a provider package please feel free to open a PR to add new providers -->

You can refer to the documentation of these packages for further instructions
on how to get access and use these systems.
