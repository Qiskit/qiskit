# Quantum Information Software Kit (QISKit)

[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/qiskit.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/qiskit)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/QISKit/qiskit-sdk-py.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/QISKit/qiskit-sdk-py)

The Quantum Information Software Kit (**QISKit** for short) is a software development kit (SDK) for working with [OpenQASM](https://github.com/QISKit/qiskit-openqasm) and the [IBM Q experience (QX)](https://quantumexperience.ng.bluemix.net/).

Use **QISKit** to create quantum computing programs, compile them, and execute them on one of several backends (online Real quantum processors, online simulators, and local simulators). For the online backends, QISKit uses our [python API client](https://github.com/QISKit/qiskit-api-py) to connect to the IBM Q experience.

**We use GitHub issues for tracking requests and bugs. Please see the** [IBM Q experience community](https://quantumexperience.ng.bluemix.net/qx/community) **for questions and discussion.** **If you'd like to contribute to QISKit, please take a look at our** [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.rst).

## Installation

### Dependencies

At least [Python 3.5 or later](https://www.python.org/downloads/) is needed for using QISKit. In addition, [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) is recommended for interacting with the tutorials.
For this reason we recommend installing the [Anaconda 3](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) python distribution, as it comes with all of these dependencies pre-installed.

In addition, a basic understanding of quantum information is very helpful when interacting with QISKit. If you're new to quantum, start with our [User Guides](https://github.com/QISKit/ibmqx-user-guides)!

### PIP Installation

For those more familiar with python, the fastest way to install QISKit is by using the PIP tool (a python package manager):

```
    pip install qiskit
```

### Source Installation

An alternative method is to clone the QISKit SDK repository onto your local machine, and change into the cloned directory:

#### Manual download

Select the "Clone or download" button at the top of this webpage (or from the URL shown in the git clone command), unzip the file if needed, and change into **qiskit-sdk-py folder** in a terminal window.

#### Git download

Or, if you have Git installed, run the following commands:

```
    git clone https://github.com/QISKit/qiskit-sdk-py
    cd qiskit-sdk-py
```

#### Setup your enviroment

We recommend using python virtual environments to improve your experience. Refer to our [Environment Setup documentation](doc/install.rst#3.1-Setup-the-environment) for more information.

## Creating your first Quantum Program

Now that the SDK is installed, it's time to begin working with QISKit.

We are ready to try out some QASM examples, which runs via the local simulator.

This is a simple superposition example.

```python
from qiskit import QuantumProgram

# Creating Programs create your first QuantumProgram object instance.
Q_program = QuantumProgram()

try:
  # Creating Registers create your first Quantum Register called "qr" with 2 qubits
  qr = Q_program.create_quantum_register("qr", 2)
  # create your first Classical Register called "cr" with 2 bits
  cr = Q_program.create_classical_register("cr", 2)
  # Creating Circuits create your first Quantum Circuit called "qc" involving your Quantum Register "qr"
  # and your Classical Register "cr"
  qc = Q_program.create_circuit("superposition", [qr], [cr])

  # add the H gate in the Qubit 0, we put this Qubit in superposition
  qc.h(qr[0])

  # add measure to see the state
  qc.measure(qr, cr)

  # Compiled  and execute in the local_qasm_simulator

  result = Q_program.execute(["superposition"], backend='local_qasm_simulator', shots=1024)

  # Show the results
  print(result)
  print(result.get_data("superposition"))

except QISKitError as ex:
  print('There was an error in the circuit!. Error = {}'.format(ex))
except RegisterSizeError as ex:
  print('Error in the number of registers!. Error = {}'.format(ex))
```

In this case, the output will be (approximately due to random fluctuations):

```
COMPLETED
{'00': 509, '11': 515}
```

You can also use QISKit to execute your code on a [real Quantum Chip](https://github.com/QISKit/ibmqx-backend-information).

 First, get your API token:

-  Create an [IBM Q experience](https://quantumexperience.ng.bluemix.net) account if you haven't already done so
-  Get an API token from the IBM Q experience website under “My Account” > “Personal Access Token”

This API token allows you to execute your programs with the IBM Q experience backends. [Example](doc/example_real_backend.rst).

More details on this and more information see [our QISKit documentation](doc/qiskit.rst).


### Next Steps

Now you're set up and ready to check out some of the other examples from our [Tutorial](https://github.com/QISKit/qiskit-tutorial) repository. Start with the [index tutorial](https://github.com/QISKit/qiskit-tutorial/blob/master/index.ipynb) and then go to the [‘Getting Started’ example](https://github.com/QISKit/qiskit-tutorial/blob/002d054c72fc59fc5009bb9fa0ee393e15a69d07/1_introduction/getting_started.ipynb). If you already have [Jupyter Notebooks installed](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html), you can copy and modify the notebooks to create your own experiments.

To install the tutorials as part of the QISKit SDK, see the following [installation details](doc/install.rst#Install-Jupyter-based-tutorials). Complete SDK documentation can be found in the [*doc* directory](doc/qiskit.rst).

QISKit was originally developed by researchers and developers on the [IBM-Q](http://www.research.ibm.com/ibm-q/) Team at [IBM Research](http://www.research.ibm.com/), with the aim of offering a high level development kit to work with quantum computers.
