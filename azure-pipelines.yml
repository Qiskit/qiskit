# stable branches can remove `stable/*` from their copy of this file once they
# reach their end-of-life.

# Conditional compilation logic.  This is all the logic for "what to run"; each
# stage in turn delegates to various templates in ".azure" that provide the
# information on "how to run" them.
#
# The conditional conditions use the template-expression syntax `${{ }}` so only
# the relevant stages even appear in the job list.  The documentation on the
# expression syntax is here:
#
#   https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/process/expressions?view=azure-devops
#
# Not all variables are available at template-expansion time - this happens
# before any machine is provisioned, so mostly you can access things from
# GitHub, but nothing about the actual machine.  This is the list of variables
# (look in the "available in templates" column):
#
#   https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/build/variables?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml
#
# The main differentiator is `variables['Build.Reason']`, which contains the
# trigger type:
#   - cron (`Schedule`)
#   - push to a git reference like a branch or tag (`IndividualCI`)
#   - push to a pull request (`PullRequest`)
# For `IndividualCI` (push/merge to a branch/tag on Qiskit/qiskit-terra), you
# need to examine `variables['Build.SourceBranch']` to determine whether it's a
# branch or a tag, and if a branch, then whether it's in the merge queue or a
# push to a "real" branch.
stages:
  # Nightly cron job.
  #
  # For this to run on a branch, the `schedules` trigger  up at the top of this
  # file needs to match on _both_ `main` and the branch itself.
