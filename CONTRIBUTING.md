Contributing to Qiskit Terra
----------------------------

You can contribute in many ways to this project.

### Issue reporting

This is a good point to start, when you find a problem please add it to
the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues). The
ideal report should include the steps to reproduce it.

### Doubts solving

To help less advanced users is another wonderful way to start. You can
help us close some opened issues. This kind of tickets should be labeled
as `question`.

### Improvement proposal

If you have an idea for a new feature please open a ticket labeled as
`enhancement`. If you could also add a piece of code with the idea or a
partial implementation it would be awesome.

### Contributor License Agreement

We\'d love to accept your code! Before we can, we have to get a few
legal requirements sorted out. By signing a contributor license
agreement (CLA), we ensure that the community is free to use your
contributions.

When you contribute to the Qiskit Terra project with a new pull request,
a bot will evaluate whether you have signed the CLA. If required, the
bot will comment on the pull request, including a link to accept the
agreement. The [individual CLA] document is available for review as a PDF.

**Note**:
> If you work for a company that wants to allow you to contribute your
> work, then you\'ll need to sign a [corporate CLA] and email it to us
> at <qiskit@us.ibm.com>.


### Good first contributions

You are welcome to contribute wherever in the code you want to, of
course, but we recommend taking a look at the \"Good first
contribution\" label into the issues and pick one. We would love to
mentor you!

### Doc

Review the parts of the documentation regarding the new changes and
update it if it\'s needed.

### Pull requests

We use [GitHub pull
requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests) to
accept the contributions.

A friendly reminder! We\'d love to have a previous discussion about the
best way to implement the feature/bug you are contributing with. This is
a good way to improve code quality in our beloved Qiskit!, so remember
to file a new Issue before starting to code for a solution.

So after having discussed the best way to land your changes into the
codebase, you are ready to start coding (yay!). We have two options
here:

1.  You think your implementation doesn\'t introduce a lot of code,
    right?. Ok, no problem, you are all set to create the PR once you
    have finished coding. We are waiting for it!
2.  Your implementation does introduce many things in the codebase. That
    sounds great! Thanks!. In this case you can start coding and create
    a PR with the word: **\[WIP\]** as a prefix of the description. This
    means \"Work In Progress\", and allow reviewers to make micro
    reviews from time to time without waiting for the big and final
    solution\... otherwise, it would make reviewing and coming changes
    pretty difficult to accomplish. The reviewer will remove the
    **\[WIP\]** prefix from the description once the PR is ready to
    merge.

#### Pull request checklist

When submitting a pull request and you feel it is ready for review,
please double check that:

-   the code follows the code style of the project. For convenience, you
    can execute `make style` and `make lint` locally, which will print
    potential style warnings and fixes.
-   the documentation has been updated accordingly. In particular, if a
    function or class has been modified during the PR, please update the
    docstring accordingly.
-   your contribution passes the existing tests, and if developing a new
    feature, that you have added new tests that cover those changes.
-   you add a new line to the `CHANGELOG.rst` file, in the `UNRELEASED`
    section, with the title of your pull request and its identifier (for
    example, \"`Replace OldComponent with FluxCapacitor (#123)`\".

#### Commit messages

Please follow the next rules for the commit messages:

-   It should include a reference to the issue ID in the first line of
    the commit, **and** a brief description of the issue, so everybody
    knows what this ID actually refers to without wasting to much time
    on following the link to the issue.
-   It should provide enough information for a reviewer to understand
    the changes and their relation to the rest of the code.

A good example:

``` {.text}
Issue #190: Short summary of the issue
* One of the important changes
* Another important change
```

Installing Qiskit Terra from source
-----------------------------------

Please see the [Installing Qiskit Terra from
Source](https://qiskit.org/documentation/install/terra.html) section of
the Qiskit documentation.

### Test

New features often imply changes in the existent tests or new ones are
needed. Once they\'re updated/added run this be sure they keep passing.

For executing the tests, a `make test` target is available. The
execution of the tests (both via the make target and during manual
invocation) takes into account the `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable. If
present, a `.log` file will be created on the test directory with the
output of the log calls, which will also be printed to stdout. You can
adjust the verbosity via the content of that variable, for example:

Linux and Mac:

``` {.bash}
$ cd out
out$ LOG_LEVEL="DEBUG" ARGS="-V" make test
```

Windows:

``` {.bash}
$ cd out
C:\..\out> set LOG_LEVEL="DEBUG"
C:\..\out> set ARGS="-V"
C:\..\out> make test
```

For executing a simple python test manually, we don\'t need to change
the directory to `out`, just run this command:

Linux and Mac:

``` {.bash}
$ LOG_LEVEL=INFO python -m unittest test/python/circuit/test_circuit_operations.py
```

Windows:

``` {.bash}
C:\..\> set LOG_LEVEL="INFO"
C:\..\> python -m unittest test/python/circuit/test_circuit_operations.py
```

##### Online Tests

Some tests require that you an IBMQ account configured. By default these
tests are always skipped. If you want to run these tests locally please
go to this
[page](https://quantumexperience.ng.bluemix.net/qx/account/advanced) and
register an account. Then you can either set the credentials explicitly
with the `IBMQ_TOKEN` and `IBMQ_URL` environment variables to specify
the token and url respectively for the ibmq service. Alternatively, if
you already have a single set of credentials configured in your
environment (using a qiskitrc) then you can just set
`QISKIT_TESTS_USE_CREDENTIALS_FILE` to `1` and it will use that.

##### Test Skip Options

How and which tests are executed is controlled by an environment
variable, `QISKIT_TESTS`:

Option | Description | Default
------ | ----------- | -------
`skip_online` | Skips tests that require remote requests. Does not require user credentials. | `False`
`run_slow` | It runs tests tagged as *slow*. | `False`

It is possible to provide more than one option separated with commas.

Alternatively, the `make test_ci` target can be used instead of
`make test` in order to run in a setup that replicates the configuration
we used in our CI systems more closely.

### Style guide

Please submit clean code and please make effort to follow existing
conventions in order to keep it as readable as possible. We use
[Pylint](https://www.pylint.org) and [PEP
8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008) style guide: to ensure your
changes respect the style guidelines, run the next commands:

All platforms:

``` {.sh}
$> cd out
out$> make lint
out$> make style
```

Documentation
-------------

The documentation for Qiskit Terra is in the `docs` directory of [Qiskit
repository](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/tree/master/docs). See this
repository for more information, however, the reference documentation is
auto-generated from the python docstrings throughout the code using
[Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org). Please follow [Google\'s Python
Style
Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html?showone=Comments#Comments)
for docstrings. A good example of the style can also be found with
[sphinx\'s napolean converter
documentation](http://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html).

Development cycle
-----------------

Our development cycle is straightforward, use the project boards in
Github for project management and use milestones for releases. The
features that we want to include in these releases will be tagged and
discussed in the project boards. Whenever a new release is close to be
launched, we\'ll announce it and detail what has changed since the
latest version in our Release Notes and Changelog. The channels we\'ll
use to announce new releases are still being discussed, but for now, you
can [follow us](https://twitter.com/qiskit) on Twitter!

### Branch model

There are two main branches in the repository:

-   `master`
    -   This is the development branch.
    -   Next release is going to be developed here. For example, if the
        current latest release version is r1.0.3, the master branch
        version will point to r1.1.0 (or r2.0.0).
    -   You should expect this branch to be updated very frequently.
    -   Even though we are always doing our best to not push code that
        breaks things, is more likely to eventually push code that
        breaks something\... we will fix it ASAP, promise :).
    -   This should not be considered as a stable branch to use in
        production environments.
    -   The API of Qiskit could change without prior notice.
-   `stable`
    -   This is our stable release branch.
    -   It\'s always synchronized with the latest distributed package,
        as for now, the package you can download from pip.
    -   The code in this branch is well tested and should be free of
        errors (unfortunately sometimes it\'s not).
    -   This is a stable branch (as the name suggest), meaning that you
        can expect stable software ready for production environments.
    -   All the tags from the release versions are created from this
        branch.

### Release cycle

From time to time, we will release brand new versions of Qiskit Terra.
These are well-tested versions of the software.

When the time for a new release has come, we will:

1.  Merge the `master` branch with the `stable` branch.
2.  Create a new tag with the version number in the `stable` branch.
3.  Crate and distribute the pip package.
4.  Change the `master` version to the next release version.
5.  Announce the new version to the world!

The `stable` branch should only receive changes in the form of bug
fixes, so the third version number (the maintenance number:
\[major\].\[minor\].\[maintenance\]) will increase on every new change.

Stable Branch Policy
====================

The stable branch is intended to be a safe source of fixes for high
impact bugs and security issues which have been fixed on master since a
release. When reviewing a stable branch PR we need to balance the risk
of any given patch with the value that it will provide to users of the
stable branch. Only a limited class of changes are appropriate for
inclusion on the stable branch. A large, risky patch for a major issue
might make sense. As might a trivial fix for a fairly obscure error
handling case. A number of factors must be weighed when considering a
change:

-   The risk of regression: even the tiniest changes carry some risk of
    breaking something and we really want to avoid regressions on the
    stable branch
-   The user visible benefit: are we fixing something that users might
    actually notice and, if so, how important is it?
-   How self-contained the fix is: if it fixes a significant issue but
    also refactors a lot of code, it's probably worth thinking about
    what a less risky fix might look like
-   Whether the fix is already on master: a change must be a backport of
    a change already merged onto master, unless the change simply does
    not make sense on master.

Backporting procedure:
----------------------

When backporting a patch from master to stable we want to keep a
reference to the change on master. When you create the branch for the
stable PR you can use:

[\$ git cherry-pick -x \$master\_commit\_id]{.title-ref}

However, this only works for small self contained patches from master.
If you need to backport a subset of a larger commit (from a squashed PR
for example) from master this just need be done manually. This should be
handled by adding:

    Backported from: #master pr number

in these cases, so we can track the source of the change subset even if
a strict cherry pick doesn\'t make sense.

If the patch you're proposing will not cherry-pick cleanly, you can help
by resolving the conflicts yourself and proposing the resulting patch.
Please keep Conflicts lines in the commit message to help review of the
stable patch.

Backport Tags
-------------

Bugs or PRs tagged with [stable backport potential]{.title-ref} are bugs
which apply to the stable release too and may be suitable for
backporting once a fix lands in master. Once the backport has been
proposed, the tag should be removed.

The PR against the stable branch should include [\[stable\]]{.title-ref}
in the title, as a sign that setting the target branch as stable was not
a mistake. Also, reference to the PR number in master that you are
porting.
