    Two unitaries :math:`A` and :math:`B` on :math:`n` qubits commute if

    and we set :math:`\varepsilon` to :math:`10^{-12}` to account for round-off errors on
    few-qubit systems. This metric is chosen for consistency with other closeness checks in
    Qiskit.

    When possible, commutation relations are queried from a lookup table. This is the case
    for standard gates without parameters (such as :class:`.XGate` or :class:`.HGate`) or
    gates with free parameters (such as :class:`.RXGate` with a :class:`.ParameterExpression` as
    angle). Otherwise, a matrix-based check is performed, where two operations are said to
    commute, if the average gate fidelity of performing the commutation is above a certain threshold
    (see ``approximation_degree``).

        Checks if two Operations commute. The return value of ``True`` means that the operations

        have conditions or have too many qubits).
