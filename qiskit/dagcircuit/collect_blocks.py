    into blocks of nodes that satisfy certain criteria. It works both with the
    :class:`~qiskit.dagcircuit.DAGCircuit` and
    :class:`~qiskit.dagcircuit.DAGDependency` representations of a DAG, where
    DagDependency takes into account commutativity between nodes.

    Collecting nodes from DAGDependency generally leads to more optimal results, but is
    slower, as it requires to construct a DAGDependency beforehand. Thus, DAGCircuit should
    be used with lower transpiler settings, and DAGDependency should be used with higher
    transpiler settings.

    In general, there are multiple ways to collect maximal blocks. The approaches used
    here are of the form 'starting from the input nodes of a DAG, greedily collect
    the largest block of nodes that match certain criteria'. For additional details,
    see https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/5775.
