(1) In circuit_to_numpy() we do not inverse the QuantumCircuit,
    Can this cause a problem?
    Suggestion: a) introduce a global flag for bit ordering reversing,
                   and use this flag everywhere.
                b) Make sure we generate matrices from circuit in coherence
                   with bit ordering!!!
