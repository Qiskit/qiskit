class AQC:
    """
    A generic implementation of the Approximate Quantum Compiler. This implementation is agnostic of
    the underlying implementation of the approximate circuit, objective, and optimizer. Users may
    pass corresponding implementations of the abstract classes:

    * The *optimizer* is an implementation of the :class:`~.Minimizer` protocol, a callable used to run
      the optimization process. The choice of optimizer may affect overall convergence, required time
      for the optimization process and achieved objective value.

    * The *approximate circuit* represents a template which parameters we want to optimize.  Currently,
      there's only one implementation based on 4-rotations CNOT unit blocks:
      :class:`.CNOTUnitCircuit`. See the paper for more details.

    * The *approximate objective* is tightly coupled with the approximate circuit implementation and
      provides two methods for computing objective function and gradient with respect to approximate
      circuit parameters. This objective is passed to the optimizer. Currently, there are two
      implementations based on 4-rotations CNOT unit blocks: :class:`.DefaultCNOTUnitObjective` and
      its accelerated version :class:`.FastCNOTUnitObjective`. Both implementations share the same
      idea of maximization the Hilbert-Schmidt product between the target matrix and its
      approximation. The former implementation approach should be considered as a baseline one. It
      may suffer from performance issues, and is mostly suitable for a small number of qubits
      (up to 5 or 6), whereas the latter, accelerated one, can be applied to larger problems.

    * One should take into consideration the exponential growth of matrix size with the number of
      qubits because the implementation not only creates a potentially large target matrix, but
      also allocates a number of temporary memory buffers comparable in size to the target matrix.
