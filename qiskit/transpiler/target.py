class Target(BaseTarget):
    """
    The intent of the ``Target`` object is to inform Qiskit's compiler about
    the constraints of a particular backend so the compiler can compile an
    input circuit to something that works and is optimized for a device. It
    currently contains a description of instructions on a backend and their
    properties as well as some timing information. However, this exact
    interface may evolve over time as the needs of the compiler change. These
    changes will be done in a backwards compatible and controlled manner when
    they are made (either through versioning, subclassing, or mixins) to add
    on to the set of information exposed by a target.

    As a basic example, let's assume backend has two qubits, supports
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.UGate` on both qubits and
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.CXGate` in both directions. To model this
    you would create the target like::

        from qiskit.transpiler import Target, InstructionProperties
        from qiskit.circuit.library import UGate, CXGate
        from qiskit.circuit import Parameter

        gmap = Target()
        theta = Parameter('theta')
        phi = Parameter('phi')
        lam = Parameter('lambda')
        u_props = {
            (0,): InstructionProperties(duration=5.23e-8, error=0.00038115),
            (1,): InstructionProperties(duration=4.52e-8, error=0.00032115),
        }
        gmap.add_instruction(UGate(theta, phi, lam), u_props)
        cx_props = {
            (0,1): InstructionProperties(duration=5.23e-7, error=0.00098115),
            (1,0): InstructionProperties(duration=4.52e-7, error=0.00132115),
        }
        gmap.add_instruction(CXGate(), cx_props)

    Each instruction in the ``Target`` is indexed by a unique string name that uniquely
    identifies that instance of an :class:`~qiskit.circuit.Instruction` object in
    the Target. There is a 1:1 mapping between a name and an
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.Instruction` instance in the target and each name must
    be unique. By default, the name is the :attr:`~qiskit.circuit.Instruction.name`
    attribute of the instruction, but can be set to anything. This lets a single
    target have multiple instances of the same instruction class with different
    parameters. For example, if a backend target has two instances of an
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.RXGate` one is parameterized over any theta
    while the other is tuned up for a theta of pi/6 you can add these by doing something
    like::

        import math

        from qiskit.transpiler import Target, InstructionProperties
        from qiskit.circuit.library import RXGate
        from qiskit.circuit import Parameter

        target = Target()
        theta = Parameter('theta')
        rx_props = {
            (0,): InstructionProperties(duration=5.23e-8, error=0.00038115),
        }
        target.add_instruction(RXGate(theta), rx_props)
        rx_30_props = {
            (0,): InstructionProperties(duration=1.74e-6, error=.00012)
        }
        target.add_instruction(RXGate(math.pi / 6), rx_30_props, name='rx_30')

    Then in the ``target`` object accessing by ``rx_30`` will get the fixed
    angle :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.RXGate` while ``rx`` will get the
    parameterized :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.RXGate`.

    .. note::

        This class assumes that qubit indices start at 0 and are a contiguous
        set if you want a submapping the bits will need to be reindexed in
        a new``Target`` object.

    .. note::

        This class only supports additions of gates, qargs, and qubits.
        If you need to remove one of these the best option is to iterate over
        an existing object and create a new subset (or use one of the methods
        to do this). The object internally caches different views and these
        would potentially be invalidated by removals.

        is repeated for each :class:`~qiskit.circuit.Instruction` the target

        Args:
            instruction (Union[qiskit.circuit.Instruction, Type[qiskit.circuit.Instruction]]):
                The operation object to add to the map. If it's parameterized any value

                instructions (such as control flow operations such as :class:`~.ForLoop` or
                :class:`~MCXGate`) you can specify the class. If the class is specified than the
                ``name`` argument must be specified. When a class is used the gate is treated as global
                and not having any properties set.

                :class:`~qiskit.transpiler.InstructionProperties` object for that

                :class:`~qiskit.transpiler.InstructionProperties` available for the
                backend the value can be None. If there are no constraints on the
                instruction (as in a noiseless/ideal simulation) this can be set to
                ``{None, None}`` which will indicate it runs on all qubits (or all
                available permutations of qubits for multi-qubit gates). The first
                ``None`` indicates it applies to all qubits and the second ``None``

                passing ``{None: None}``.
            name (str): An optional name to use for identifying the instruction. If not
                specified the :attr:`~qiskit.circuit.Instruction.name` attribute
                of ``gate`` will be used. All gates in the ``Target`` need unique

            coupling_map: The coupling map representing connectivity constraints
                on the backend. If specified all gates from ``basis_gates`` will

                :class:`~InstructionProperties` objects for the instructions in the target.

                ``basis_gates`` to an :class:`~.Operation` object representing that
