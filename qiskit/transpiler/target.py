class Target(Mapping):
    """
    The intent of the ``Target`` object is to inform Qiskit's compiler about
    the constraints of a particular backend so the compiler can compile an
    input circuit to something that works and is optimized for a device. It
    currently contains a description of instructions on a backend and their
    properties as well as some timing information. However, this exact
    interface may evolve over time as the needs of the compiler change. These
    changes will be done in a backwards compatible and controlled manner when
    they are made (either through versioning, subclassing, or mixins) to add
    on to the set of information exposed by a target.

    As a basic example, let's assume backend has two qubits, supports
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.UGate` on both qubits and
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.CXGate` in both directions. To model this
    you would create the target like::

        from qiskit.transpiler import Target, InstructionProperties
        from qiskit.circuit.library import UGate, CXGate
        from qiskit.circuit import Parameter

        gmap = Target()
        theta = Parameter('theta')
        phi = Parameter('phi')
        lam = Parameter('lambda')
        u_props = {
            (0,): InstructionProperties(duration=5.23e-8, error=0.00038115),
            (1,): InstructionProperties(duration=4.52e-8, error=0.00032115),
        }
        gmap.add_instruction(UGate(theta, phi, lam), u_props)
        cx_props = {
            (0,1): InstructionProperties(duration=5.23e-7, error=0.00098115),
            (1,0): InstructionProperties(duration=4.52e-7, error=0.00132115),
        }
        gmap.add_instruction(CXGate(), cx_props)

    Each instruction in the ``Target`` is indexed by a unique string name that uniquely
    identifies that instance of an :class:`~qiskit.circuit.Instruction` object in
    the Target. There is a 1:1 mapping between a name and an
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.Instruction` instance in the target and each name must
    be unique. By default, the name is the :attr:`~qiskit.circuit.Instruction.name`
    attribute of the instruction, but can be set to anything. This lets a single
    target have multiple instances of the same instruction class with different
    parameters. For example, if a backend target has two instances of an
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.RXGate` one is parameterized over any theta
    while the other is tuned up for a theta of pi/6 you can add these by doing something
    like::

        import math

        from qiskit.transpiler import Target, InstructionProperties
        from qiskit.circuit.library import RXGate
        from qiskit.circuit import Parameter

        target = Target()
        theta = Parameter('theta')
        rx_props = {
            (0,): InstructionProperties(duration=5.23e-8, error=0.00038115),
        }
        target.add_instruction(RXGate(theta), rx_props)
        rx_30_props = {
            (0,): InstructionProperties(duration=1.74e-6, error=.00012)
        }
        target.add_instruction(RXGate(math.pi / 6), rx_30_props, name='rx_30')

    Then in the ``target`` object accessing by ``rx_30`` will get the fixed
    angle :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.RXGate` while ``rx`` will get the
    parameterized :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.RXGate`.

    .. note::

        This class assumes that qubit indices start at 0 and are a contiguous
        set if you want a submapping the bits will need to be reindexed in
        a new``Target`` object.

    .. note::

        This class only supports additions of gates, qargs, and qubits.
        If you need to remove one of these the best option is to iterate over
        an existing object and create a new subset (or use one of the methods
        to do this). The object internally caches different views and these
        would potentially be invalidated by removals.

                this or ``operation_class`` must be specified, if both are specified
                ``operation_class`` will take priority and this argument will be ignored.

                not specified then this method will return ``True`` if the specified
                operation is supported on any qubits. The typical application will
                always have this set (otherwise it's the same as just checking if the
                target contains the operation). Normally you would not set this argument
                if you wanted to check more generally that the target supports an operation
                with the ``parameters`` on any qubits.
            operation_class (Type[qiskit.circuit.Instruction]): The operation class to check whether
                the target supports a particular operation by class rather
                than by name. This lookup is more expensive as it needs to
                iterate over all operations in the target instead of just a
                single lookup. If this is specified it will supersede the
                ``operation_name`` argument. The typical use case for this
                operation is to check whether a specific variant of an operation
                is supported on the backend. For example, if you wanted to
                check whether a :class:`~.RXGate` was supported on a specific
                qubit with a fixed angle. That fixed angle variant will
                typically have a name different from the object's
                :attr:`~.Instruction.name` attribute (``"rx"``) in the target.
                This can be used to check if any instances of the class are
                available in such a case.
            parameters (list): A list of parameters to check if the target
                supports them on the specified qubits. If the instruction
                supports the parameter values specified in the list on the
                operation and qargs specified this will return ``True`` but
                if the parameters are not supported on the specified
                instruction it will return ``False``. If this argument is not
                specified this method will return ``True`` if the instruction
                is supported independent of the instruction parameters. If
                specified with any :class:`~.Parameter` objects in the list,
                that entry will be treated as supporting any value, however parameter names
                will not be checked (for example if an operation in the target
                is listed as parameterized with ``"theta"`` and ``"phi"`` is
                passed into this function that will return ``True``). For
                example, if called with::

                    parameters = [Parameter("theta")]
                    target.instruction_supported("rx", (0,), parameters=parameters)

                will return ``True`` if an :class:`~.RXGate` is supported on qubit 0
                that will accept any parameter. If you need to check for a fixed numeric
                value parameter this argument is typically paired with the ``operation_class``
                argument. For example::

                    target.instruction_supported("rx", (0,), RXGate, parameters=[pi / 4])

                will return ``True`` if an RXGate(pi/4) exists on qubit 0.

        """Create a target object from the individual global configuration

        Prior to the creation of the :class:`~.Target` class, the constraints
        of a backend were represented by a collection of different objects
        which combined represent a subset of the information contained in
        the :class:`~.Target`. This function provides a simple interface
        to convert those separate objects to a :class:`~.Target`.

        This constructor will use the input from ``basis_gates``, ``num_qubits``,
        and ``coupling_map`` to build a base model of the backend and the
        ``instruction_durations``, ``backend_properties``, and ``inst_map`` inputs
        are then queried (in that order) based on that model to look up the properties
        of each instruction and qubit. If there is an inconsistency between the inputs
        any extra or conflicting information present in ``instruction_durations``,
        ``backend_properties``, or ``inst_map`` will be ignored.

        Args:
            basis_gates: The list of basis gate names for the backend. For the
                target to be created these names must either be in the output
                from :func:`~.get_standard_gate_name_mapping` or present in the
                specified ``custom_name_mapping`` argument.
            num_qubits: The number of qubits supported on the backend.
            coupling_map: The coupling map representing connectivity constraints
                on the backend. If specified all gates from ``basis_gates`` will
                be supported on all qubits (or pairs of qubits).
            inst_map: The instruction schedule map representing the pulse
               :class:`~.Schedule` definitions for each instruction. If this
               is specified ``coupling_map`` must be specified. The
               ``coupling_map`` is used as the source of truth for connectivity
               and if ``inst_map`` is used the schedule is looked up based
               on the instructions from the pair of ``basis_gates`` and
               ``coupling_map``. If you want to define a custom gate for
               a particular qubit or qubit pair, you can manually build :class:`.Target`.
            backend_properties: The :class:`~.BackendProperties` object which is
                used for instruction properties and qubit properties.
                If specified and instruction properties are intended to be used
                then the ``coupling_map`` argument must be specified. This is
                only used to lookup error rates and durations (unless
                ``instruction_durations`` is specified which would take
                precedence) for instructions specified via ``coupling_map`` and
                ``basis_gates``.
            instruction_durations: Optional instruction durations for instructions. If specified
                it will take priority for setting the ``duration`` field in the
                :class:`~InstructionProperties` objects for the instructions in the target.
            concurrent_measurements(list): A list of sets of qubits that must be
                measured together. This must be provided
                as a nested list like ``[[0, 1], [2, 3, 4]]``.
            dt: The system time resolution of input signals in seconds
            timing_constraints: Optional timing constraints to include in the
                :class:`~.Target`
            custom_name_mapping: An optional dictionary that maps custom gate/operation names in
                ``basis_gates`` to an :class:`~.Operation` object representing that
                gate/operation. By default, most standard gates names are mapped to the
                standard gate object from :mod:`qiskit.circuit.library` this only needs
                to be specified if the input ``basis_gates`` defines gates in names outside
                that set.

        Returns:
            Target: the target built from the input configuration

        Raises:
            TranspilerError: If the input basis gates contain > 2 qubits and ``coupling_map`` is
            specified.
            KeyError: If no mapping is available for a specified ``basis_gate``.
