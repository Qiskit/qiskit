                physical qubits.
            basis_gates (list): List of basis gate names to unroll to.
            inst_map (InstructionScheduleMap): Mapping object that maps gate to schedule.
            coupling_map (CouplingMap): Directed graph represented a coupling
                map.
            layout_method (str): the pass to use for choosing initial qubit
                placement.
