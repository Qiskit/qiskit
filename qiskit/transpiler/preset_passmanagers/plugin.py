Transpiler Stage Plugin Interface (:mod:`qiskit.transpiler.preset_passmanagers.plugin`)
=======================================================================================

.. currentmodule:: qiskit.transpiler.preset_passmanagers.plugin

This module defines the plugin interface for providing custom stage
implementations for the preset pass managers and the :func:`~.transpile`
function. This enables external Python packages to provide
:class:`~.PassManager` objects that can be used for each named stage.

The plugin interfaces are built using setuptools
`entry points <https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/userguide/entry_point.html>`__
which enable packages external to Qiskit to advertise they include a transpiler stage(s).

For details on how to instead write plugins for transpiler synthesis methods,
see :mod:`qiskit.transpiler.passes.synthesis.plugin`.


.. _stage_table:

Plugin Stages
=============

Currently, there are 6 stages in the preset pass managers, all of which actively
load external plugins via corresponding entry points.

.. list-table:: Stages
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Stage Name
     - Entry Point
     - Reserved Names
     - Description and expectations
   * - ``init``
     - ``qiskit.transpiler.init``
     - ``default``
     - This stage runs first and is typically used for any initial logical optimization. Because most
       layout and routing algorithms are only designed to work with 1 and 2 qubit gates, this stage
       is also used to translate any gates that operate on more than 2 qubits into gates that only
       operate on 1 or 2 qubits.
   * - ``layout``
     - ``qiskit.transpiler.layout``
     - ``trivial``, ``dense``, ``sabre``, ``default``
     - The output from this stage is expected to have the ``layout`` property
       set field set with a :class:`~.Layout` object. Additionally, the circuit is
       typically expected to be embedded so that it is expanded to include all
       qubits and the :class:`~.ApplyLayout` pass is expected to be run to apply the
       layout. The embedding of the :class:`~.Layout` can be generated with
       :func:`~.generate_embed_passmanager`.
   * - ``routing``
     - ``qiskit.transpiler.routing``
     - ``basic``, ``stochastic``, ``lookahead``, ``sabre``
     - The output from this stage is expected to have the circuit match the
       connectivity constraints of the target backend. This does not necessarily
       need to match the directionality of the edges in the target as a later
       stage typically will adjust directional gates to match that constraint
       (but there is no penalty for doing that in the ``routing`` stage). The output
       of this stage is also expected to have the ``final_layout`` property set field
       set with a :class:`~.Layout` object that maps the :class:`.Qubit` to the
       output final position of that qubit in the circuit. If there is an
       existing ``final_layout`` entry in the property set (such as might be set
       by an optimization pass that introduces a permutation) it is expected
       that the final layout will be the composition of the two layouts (this
       can be computed using :meth:`.DAGCircuit.compose`, for example:
       ``second_final_layout.compose(first_final_layout, dag.qubits)``).
   * - ``translation``
     - ``qiskit.transpiler.translation``
     - ``translator``, ``synthesis``, ``unroller``
     - The output of this stage is expected to have every operation be a native
        instruction on the target backend.
   * - ``optimization``
     - ``qiskit.transpiler.optimization``
     - ``default``
     - This stage is expected to perform optimization and simplification.
       The constraints from earlier stages still apply to the output of this
       stage. After the ``optimization`` stage is run we expect the circuit
       to still be executable on the target.
   * - ``scheduling``
     - ``qiskit.transpiler.scheduling``
     - ``alap``, ``asap``, ``default``
     - This is the last stage run and it is expected to output a scheduled
       circuit such that all idle periods in the circuit are marked by explicit
       :class:`~qiskit.circuit.Delay` instructions.

Writing Plugins
===============

To write a pass manager stage plugin there are 2 main steps. The first step is
to create a subclass of the abstract plugin class
:class:`~.PassManagerStagePlugin` which is used to define how the :class:`~.PassManager`
for the stage will be constructed. For example, to create a ``layout`` stage plugin that just
runs :class:`~.VF2Layout` (with increasing amount of trials, depending on the optimization level)
and falls back to using :class:`~.TrivialLayout` if
:class:`~VF2Layout` is unable to find a perfect layout::

    from qiskit.transpiler.preset_passmanagers.plugin import PassManagerStagePlugin
    from qiskit.transpiler.preset_passmanagers import common
    from qiskit.transpiler import PassManager
    from qiskit.transpiler.passes import VF2Layout, TrivialLayout
    from qiskit.transpiler.passes.layout.vf2_layout import VF2LayoutStopReason


    def _vf2_match_not_found(property_set):
        return property_set["layout"] is None or (
            property_set["VF2Layout_stop_reason"] is not None
            and property_set["VF2Layout_stop_reason"] is not VF2LayoutStopReason.SOLUTION_FOUND


    class VF2LayoutPlugin(PassManagerStagePlugin):

        def pass_manager(self, pass_manager_config, optimization_level):
            layout_pm = PassManager(
                [
                    VF2Layout(
                        coupling_map=pass_manager_config.coupling_map,
                        properties=pass_manager_config.backend_properties,
                        max_trials=optimization_level * 10 + 1
                        target=pass_manager_config.target
                    )
                ]
            )
            layout_pm.append(
                TrivialLayout(pass_manager_config.coupling_map),
                condition=_vf2_match_not_found,
            )
            layout_pm += common.generate_embed_passmanager(pass_manager_config.coupling_map)
            return layout_pm

The second step is to expose the :class:`~.PassManagerStagePlugin`
subclass as a setuptools entry point in the package metadata. This can be done
an ``entry-points`` table in ``pyproject.toml`` for the plugin package with the necessary entry
points under the appropriate namespace for the stage your plugin is for. You can see the list of
stages, entry points, and expectations from the stage in :ref:`stage_table`.  For example,
continuing from the example plugin above::

.. code-block:: toml

    [project.entry-points."qiskit.transpiler.layout"]
    "vf2" = "qiskit_plugin_pkg.module.plugin:VF2LayoutPlugin"

There isn't a limit to the number of plugins a single package can include as long as each plugin has
a unique name. So a single package can expose multiple plugins if necessary. Refer to
:ref:`stage_table` for a list of reserved names for each stage.
