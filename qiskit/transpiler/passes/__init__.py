Transpiler Passes (:mod:`qiskit.transpiler.passes`)
===================================================

.. currentmodule:: qiskit.transpiler.passes

Working with transpiler passes
==============================

Transpiler passes are the individual building blocks used by
:class:`~qiskit.transpiler.PassManager` objects to analyze or rewrite circuits.
They operate on Qiskit's internal :class:`~qiskit.dagcircuit.DAGCircuit`
representation, but users typically run them through a pass manager using
:class:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit` inputs.

There are two broad kinds of pass:

* :class:`~qiskit.transpiler.AnalysisPass` objects inspect a circuit and write
  information into the pass manager's
  :class:`~qiskit.transpiler.PropertySet`. They do not change the circuit.
* :class:`~qiskit.transpiler.TransformationPass` objects rewrite the circuit.
  They can also read information that earlier analysis passes stored in the
  property set.

For complete device-aware compilation, start with
:func:`~qiskit.transpiler.generate_preset_pass_manager`. The passes below are
useful when you want to inspect a circuit, build a smaller custom workflow, or
customize one stage of transpilation.

For example, an analysis pass can be used to collect information about a
circuit::

    from qiskit.circuit import QuantumCircuit  # Build circuits.
    from qiskit.transpiler import PassManager  # Run passes.
    from qiskit.transpiler.passes import CountOps  # Count operations.

    circuit = QuantumCircuit(2)  # Make a 2-qubit circuit.
    circuit.h(0)  # Add an H gate.
    circuit.cx(0, 1)  # Add a CX gate.

    pass_manager = PassManager([CountOps()])  # Create the workflow.
    pass_manager.run(circuit)  # Run the analysis.
    print(pass_manager.property_set["count_ops"])  # Show the result.

Transformation passes can be combined to build a small custom compilation
workflow. This example removes a barrier and then cancels two adjacent
self-inverse gates::

    from qiskit.circuit import QuantumCircuit  # Build circuits.
    from qiskit.circuit.library import HGate  # Name the H gate.
    from qiskit.transpiler import PassManager  # Run passes.
    from qiskit.transpiler.passes import InverseCancellation, RemoveBarriers  # Import passes.

    circuit = QuantumCircuit(1)  # Make a 1-qubit circuit.
    circuit.h(0)  # Add the first H gate.
    circuit.barrier()  # Add a barrier.
    circuit.h(0)  # Add the second H gate.

    pass_manager = PassManager(  # Create the workflow.
        [  # Set the pass order.
            RemoveBarriers(),  # Remove the barrier.
            InverseCancellation([HGate()]),  # Cancel adjacent H gates.
        ]  # End the pass list.
    )  # End the workflow.
    simplified = pass_manager.run(circuit)  # Run the transforms.

Pass categories
===============

The categories below group passes by the role they usually play in a
transpilation workflow. A preset pass manager may use passes from several
categories in one stage, run a category more than once, or skip a category when
it is not needed for the target.

Layout Selection (Placement)
============================

Layout-selection passes choose or validate the mapping from the circuit's
virtual qubits to the target's physical qubits. Some passes simply apply a
provided layout, while others search for a layout that reduces routing or
hardware error.

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: ../stubs/

   SetLayout
   TrivialLayout
   DenseLayout
   SabreLayout
   CSPLayout
   VF2Layout
   ApplyLayout
   Layout2qDistance
   EnlargeWithAncilla
   FullAncillaAllocation
   SabrePreLayout

Routing
=======

Routing passes insert operations, typically swaps, so that every multi-qubit
operation satisfies the target connectivity. These passes usually run after a
layout has been selected.

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: ../stubs/

   BasicSwap
   Commuting2qGateRouter
   LayoutTransformation
   LookaheadSwap
   SabreSwap
   StarPreRouting

Basis Change
============

Basis-change passes rewrite instructions into a requested gate set or target
instruction set. These are often used after routing, when the circuit topology
is compatible with the target but its operations still need to be expressed in
the target basis.

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: ../stubs/

   BasisTranslator
   Decompose
   TranslateParameterizedGates
   Unroll3qOrMore
   UnrollCustomDefinitions

Optimizations
=============

Optimization passes reduce or simplify a circuit while preserving its
semantics. Some are general-purpose, such as cancellation of inverse gates,
while others use target information or specialized synthesis routines.

   :toctree: ../stubs/

Scheduling
=============

Scheduling passes assign timing information to circuit instructions and insert
delays when required. They are typically used late in the transpilation
pipeline, once the circuit is expressed in target-supported operations.

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: ../stubs/

   ALAPScheduleAnalysis
   ASAPScheduleAnalysis
   ConstrainedReschedule
   ContextAwareDynamicalDecoupling
   InstructionDurationCheck
   PadDelay
   PadDynamicalDecoupling
   SetIOLatency
   TimeUnitConversion

Circuit Analysis
================

Circuit-analysis passes compute properties such as circuit size, depth, or
operation counts. These passes are useful for reporting and for controlling
later conditional stages in a pass manager.

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: ../stubs/

   CountOps
   CountOpsLongestPath
   DAGLongestPath
   Depth
   NumTensorFactors
   ResourceEstimation
   Size
   Width

Synthesis
=========

Synthesis passes replace high-level objects, unitaries, or arithmetic
operations with lower-level circuits. They are commonly used before or during
basis translation.

The synthesis transpiler plugin documentation can be found in the
:mod:`qiskit.transpiler.passes.synthesis.plugin` page.

   :toctree: ../stubs/

   HLSConfig
   HighLevelSynthesis
   LinearFunctionsToPermutations
   SolovayKitaev
   SynthesizeRZRotations
   UnitarySynthesis

Post Layout
===========

Post-layout passes run after an initial layout has been chosen. They can refine
or validate the selected physical qubits before later routing and optimization
stages.

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: ../stubs/

   VF2PostLayout

Additional Passes
=================

These utility passes support common pass-manager tasks such as checking target
constraints, removing barriers or measurements, tracking fixed points, and
wrapping angles.

   :toctree: ../stubs/

   CheckGateDirection
   CheckMap
   ContainsInstruction

   MergeAdjacentBarriers
   MinimumPoint

   RemoveFinalMeasurements
   UnrollForLoops
   WrapAngles

Additional data
===============

.. py:data:: qiskit.transpiler.passes.utils.wrap_angles.WRAP_ANGLE_REGISTRY

    A legacy location for :attr:`.WrapAngles.DEFAULT_REGISTRY`.  This path should only be used when
    full compatibility with Qiskit 2.2 is required.
