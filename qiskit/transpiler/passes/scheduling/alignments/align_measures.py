class AlignMeasures(TransformationPass):
    """Measurement alignment.

    This is a control electronics aware optimization pass.

    In many quantum computing architectures gates (instructions) are implemented with
    shaped analog stimulus signals. These signals are digitally stored in the
    waveform memory of the control electronics and converted into analog voltage signals
    by electronic components called digital to analog converters (DAC).

    In a typical hardware implementation of superconducting quantum processors,
    a single qubit instruction is implemented by a
    microwave signal with the duration of around several tens of ns with a per-sample
    time resolution of ~0.1-10ns, as reported by ``backend.configuration().dt``.
    In such systems requiring higher DAC bandwidth, control electronics often
    defines a `pulse granularity`, in other words a data chunk, to allow the DAC to
    perform the signal conversion in parallel to gain the bandwidth.

    Measurement alignment is required if a backend only allows triggering ``measure``
    instructions at a certain multiple value of this pulse granularity.
    This value is usually provided by ``backend.configuration().timing_constraints``.

    In Qiskit SDK, the duration of delay can take arbitrary value in units of ``dt``,
    thus circuits involving delays may violate the above alignment constraint (i.e. misalignment).
    This pass shifts measurement instructions to a new time position to fix the misalignment,
    by inserting extra delay right before the measure instructions.
    The input of this pass should be scheduled :class:`~qiskit.dagcircuit.DAGCircuit`,
    thus one should select one of the scheduling passes
    (:class:`~qiskit.transpiler.passes.ALAPSchedule` or
    :class:`~qiskit.trasnpiler.passes.ASAPSchedule`) before calling this.

    Examples:
        We assume executing the following circuit on a backend with ``alignment=16``.

        .. parsed-literal::

                 ┌───┐┌────────────────┐┌─┐
            q_0: ┤ X ├┤ Delay(100[dt]) ├┤M├
                 └───┘└────────────────┘└╥┘
            c: 1/════════════════════════╩═
                                         0

        Note that delay of 100 dt induces a misalignment of 4 dt at the measurement.
        This pass appends an extra 12 dt time shift to the input circuit.

        .. parsed-literal::

                 ┌───┐┌────────────────┐┌─┐
            q_0: ┤ X ├┤ Delay(112[dt]) ├┤M├
                 └───┘└────────────────┘└╥┘
            c: 1/════════════════════════╩═
                                         0

        This pass always inserts a positive delay before measurements
        rather than reducing other delays.

    Notes:
        The Backend may allow users to execute circuits violating the alignment constraint.
        However, it may return meaningless measurement data mainly due to the phase error.
