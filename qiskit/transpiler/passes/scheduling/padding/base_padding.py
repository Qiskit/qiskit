class BasePadding(TransformationPass):
    """The base class of padding pass.

    This pass requires one of scheduling passes to be executed before itself.
    Since there are multiple scheduling strategies, the selection of scheduling
    pass is left in the hands of the pass manager designer.
    Once a scheduling analysis pass is run, ``node_start_time`` is generated
    in the :attr:`property_set`.  This information is represented by a python dictionary of
    the expected instruction execution times keyed on the node instances.
    Entries in the dictionary are only created for non-delay nodes.
    The padding pass expects all ``DAGOpNode`` in the circuit to be scheduled.

    This base class doesn't define any sequence to interleave, but it manages
    the location where the sequence is inserted, and provides a set of information necessary
    to construct the proper sequence. Thus, a subclass of this pass just needs to implement
    :meth:`_pad` method, in which the subclass constructs a circuit block to insert.
    This mechanism removes lots of boilerplate logic to manage whole DAG circuits.

    Note that padding pass subclasses should define interleaving sequences satisfying:

        - Interleaved sequence does not change start time of other nodes
        - Interleaved sequence should have total duration of the provided ``time_interval``.

    Any manipulation violating these constraints may prevent this base pass from correctly
    tracking the start time of each instruction,
    which may result in violation of hardware alignment constraints.
