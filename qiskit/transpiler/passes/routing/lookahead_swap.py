class LookaheadSwap(TransformationPass):
    """Map input circuit onto a backend topology via insertion of SWAPs.

    Implementation of Sven Jandura's swap mapper submission for the 2018 Qiskit
    Developer Challenge, adapted to integrate into the transpiler architecture.

    The role of the swapper pass is to modify the starting circuit to be compatible
    with the target device's topology (the set of two-qubit gates available on the
    hardware.) To do this, the pass will insert SWAP gates to relocate the virtual
    qubits for each upcoming gate onto a set of coupled physical qubits. However, as
    SWAP gates are particularly lossy, the goal is to accomplish this remapping while
    introducing the fewest possible additional SWAPs.

    This algorithm searches through the available combinations of SWAP gates by means
    of a narrowed best first/beam search, described as follows:

    - Start with a layout of virtual qubits onto physical qubits.
    - Find any gates in the input circuit which can be performed with the current
      layout and mark them as mapped.
    - For all possible SWAP gates, calculate the layout that would result from their
      application and rank them according to the distance of the resulting layout
      over upcoming gates (see _calc_layout_distance.)
    - For the four (search_width) highest-ranking SWAPs, repeat the above process on
      the layout that would be generated if they were applied.
    - Repeat this process down to a depth of four (search_depth) SWAPs away from the
      initial layout, for a total of 256 (search_width^search_depth) prospective
      layouts.
    - Choose the layout which maximizes the number of two-qubit which could be
      performed. Add its mapped gates, including the SWAPs generated, to the
      output circuit.
    - Repeat the above until all gates from the initial circuit are mapped.

    For more details on the algorithm, see Sven's blog post:
