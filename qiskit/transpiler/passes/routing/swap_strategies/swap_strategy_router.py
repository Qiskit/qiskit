class SwapStrategyRouter(TransformationPass):
    """An abstract base class to swap route one or more instructions to the coupling map.

    The mapping to the coupling map is done using swap strategies. Sub-classes must inherit
    from SwapStrategyRouter to define the type of instruction that they can handle and how to
    handle it.

    The swap strategy should suit the problem and the coupling map. This transpiler pass
    should ideally be executed before the quantum circuit is enlarged with any idle ancilla
    qubits. Otherwise we may swap qubits outside of the portion of the chip we want to use.
    Therefore, the swap strategy and its associated coupling map do not represent physical
    qubits. Instead, they represent an intermediate mapping that corresponds to the physical
    qubits once the initial layout is applied. The example below shows how to map a four
    qubit PauliEvolutionGate to qubits 0, 1, 3, and 4 of the five qubit device with the
    coupling map

    .. parsed-literal::

        0 -- 1 -- 2
             |
             3
             |
             4

    To do this we use a line swap strategy for qubits 0, 1, 3, and 4 defined it in terms
    of logical qubits 0, 1, 2, and 3.

    layers in between and the ``current_layout`` will be modified. Nodes that should not be
    routed using swap strategies will be added back to the dag taking the ``current_layout``

            means that before any SWAP gates are applied we can apply ZZ gates on logical
            qubits (2, 3) and (0, 1). Then, after 1 layer of the swap strategy we can
            apply the gate between logical qubits 0 and 3 since they have become adjacent.

        Raises:
           QiskitError: If the Pauli coefficient has an iaginary part.
