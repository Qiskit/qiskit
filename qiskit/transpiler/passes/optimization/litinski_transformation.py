class LitinskiTransformation(TransformationPass):
    r"""Applies Litinski transform to a circuit.

    The transform applies to a circuit containing Clifford, single-qubit :math:`R_Z`-rotation gates
    (including :math:`T` and :math:`T^\dagger`), and standard :math:`Z`-measurements, and moves
    Clifford gates to the end of the circuit. In the process, it transforms :math:`R_Z`-rotations to
    Pauli product rotations, and :math:`Z`-measurements to Pauli product measurements.

    The pass supports all of the Clifford gates in the list returned by
    :func:`.get_clifford_gate_names`:

    ``["id", "x", "y", "z", "h", "s", "sdg", "sx", "sxdg", "cx", "cz", "cy",
    "swap","iswap", "ecr", "dcx"]``

    The list of supported :math:`R_Z`-rotations is:

    ``["t", "tdg", "rz", "p", "u1"]``

        pm.optimization.append(litinski)
