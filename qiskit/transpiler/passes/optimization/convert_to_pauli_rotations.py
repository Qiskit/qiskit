    Convert a quantum circuit containing single-qubit, two-qubit and three-qubit
    standard gates, barriers and measurements, into an equivalent circuit containing
    :class:`.PauliProductRotationGate` gates
    and :class:`.PauliProductMeasurement` instructions.

    For example::

      from qiskit.circuit import QuantumCircuit
      from qiskit.transpiler.passes import ConvertToPauliRotations
      from qiskit.quantum_info import Operator

      qc = QuantumCircuit(3)
      qc.h(0)
      qc.cx(0, 1)
      qc.ry(0.123, 0)
      qc.t(2)
      qc.rzz(pi/4, 0, 2)

      # The transformed circuit consists of PauliProductRotationGate gates
      qct = ConvertToPauliRotations()(qc)
      ops_names = set(qct.count_ops().keys())
      self.assertEqual(ops_names, {"pauli_product_rotation"})

      # The circuits before and after the transformation are equivalent
      assert Operator(qc) == Operator(qct)
