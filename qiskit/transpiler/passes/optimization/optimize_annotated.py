    """Optimization pass on circuits with annotated operations.

    Implemented optimizations:

    * For each annotated operation, converting the list of its modifiers to a canonical form.
      For example, consecutively applying ``inverse()``, ``control(2)`` and ``inverse()``
      is equivalent to applying ``control(2)``.

    * Removing annotations when possible.
      For example, ``AnnotatedOperation(SwapGate(), [InverseModifier(), InverseModifier()])``
      is equivalent to ``SwapGate()``.

    * Recursively combining annotations.
      For example, if ``g1 = AnnotatedOperation(SwapGate(), InverseModifier())`` and
      ``g2 = AnnotatedOperation(g1, ControlModifier(2))``, then ``g2`` can be replaced with
      ``AnnotatedOperation(SwapGate(), [InverseModifier(), ControlModifier(2)])``.

    * Applies conjugate reduction to annotated operations. As an example,
      ``control - [P -- Q -- P^{-1}]`` can be rewritten as ``P -- control - [Q] -- P^{-1}``,
      that is, only the middle part needs to be controlled. This also works for inverse
      and power modifiers.
