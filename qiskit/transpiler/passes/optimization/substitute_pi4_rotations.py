class SubstitutePi4Rotations(TransformationPass):
    r"""Convert rotation gates whose angles are integer multiples of :math:`\pi/4` into discrete
    sets of Clifford, :class:`.TGate` and :class:`.TdgGate` gates.

    For single-qubit rotation gates (:class:`.RXGate`, :class:`.RYGate`, :class:`.RZGate`,
    :class:`.PhaseGate`) and two-qubit rotation gates (:class:`.RXXGate`, :class:`.RYYGate`,
    :class:`.RZZGate`, :class:`.RZXGate`),
    when the angle is a multiple of :math:`\pi/4`, the decomposition requires
    a single :class:`.TGate` or :class:`.TdgGate` gate as well as some Clifford gates.
    For two-qubit controlled rotation gates (:class:`.CPhaseGate`, :class:`.CRXGate`,
    :class:`.CRYGate`,
    :class:`.CRZGate), when the angle is a multiple of :math:`\pi/2`, the decomposition requires
    three :class:`.TGate` or :class:`.TdgGate`gates for :class:`.CPhaseGate`and two otherwise,
    as well as some Clifford gates.
    Note that even multiples of :math:`\pi/4` (respectively, :math:`\pi/2` for controlled rotations),
    or equivalently, integer multiples of :math:`\pi/2`
    (respectively :math:`\pi` for controlled rotations) can be written using only Clifford gates.

    For example::

      from qiskit.circuit import QuantumCircuit
      from qiskit.transpiler.passes import SubstitutePi4Rotations
      from qiskit.quantum_info import Operator

      # The following quantum circuit consists of 5 Clifford gates,
      # four rotation gates whose angles are integer multiples of pi/4,
      # and one controlled rotation gate whose angle is an integer multiple pf pi/2

      qc.rx(3*pi/4, 1)
      qc.h(1)
      qc.s(2)
      qc.ry(2*pi/4, 2)
      qc.cz(2, 0)
      qc.rzz(pi/4, 0, 2)
      qc.cry(3*pi/2, 2, 1)

      # The circuits before and after the transformation are equivalent
      assert Operator(qc) == Operator(qct)
