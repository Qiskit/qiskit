    This pass will analyze all :class:`.UnitaryGate` instances and determine whether the
    matrix is actually a product of 2 single qubit gates. In these cases the 2q gate can be
    simplified into two single qubit gates and this pass will perform this optimization and will
    replace the two qubit gate with two single qubit :class:`.UnitaryGate`.

    If some of the gates can be viewed as a swap joined by the product of 2 single qubit gates,
    the pass will recreate the DAG, permuting the swapped qubits similar
