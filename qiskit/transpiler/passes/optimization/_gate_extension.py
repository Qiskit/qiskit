"""
Dynamically extend Gate classes with functions required for the Hoare
optimizer, namely triviality-conditions and post-conditions.
If `_trivial_if` returns `True` and the qubit is in a classical state
then the gate is trivial.
If a gate has no `_trivial_if`, then is assumed to be non-trivial.
If a gate has no `_postconditions`, then is assumed to have unknown post-conditions.
