    Removes gates whose effect is close to an identity operation, up to the specified
    tolerance. Zero qubit gates such as :class:`.GlobalPhaseGate` are not considered
    by this pass.

    For a cutoff fidelity :math:`f`, this pass removes gates whose average
    gate fidelity with respect to the identity is below :math:`f`. Concretely,
    a gate :math:`G` is removed if :math:`\bar F < f` where

    .. math::

        \bar{F} = \frac{1 + F_{\text{process}}}{1 + d},\ 

        F_{\text{process}} = \frac{|\mathrm{Tr}(G)|^2}{d^2}

    where :math:`d = 2^n` is the dimension of the gate for :math:`n` qubits.
