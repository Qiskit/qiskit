class TwoQubitPeepholeOptimization(TransformationPass):
    """Unified two qubit unitary peephole optimization

    This transpiler pass is designed to perform two qubit unitary peephole
    optimization. This pass finds all the 2 qubit blocks in the circuit,
    computes the unitary of that block, and then synthesizes that unitary.
    If the synthesized two qubit unitary is "better" than the original
    subcircuit that subcircuit is used to replace the original. The heuristic
    used to determine if it's better first looks at the two qubit gate count
    in the circuit, and prefers the synthesis with fewer two qubit gates, if
    the two qubit gate counts are the same then it looks at the estimated
    fidelity of the circuit and picks the subcircuit with higher estimated
    fidelity, and finally if needed it picks the subcircuit with the fewest
    total gates.

    In case the target is overcomplete the pass will try all the
    decomposers supported for all the gates supported on a given qubit.
    The decomposition that has the best expected performance using the above
    heuristic will be selected and used to replace the block.

    This pass is designed to be run on a physical circuit and the details of
    operations on a given qubit is assumed to be the hardware qubit from the
    target. However, the output of the pass might not use hardware operations,
    specifically single qubit gates might be emitted outside the target's supported
    operations, typically only if a parameterized gate supported by the
    :class:`.TwoQubitControlledUDecomposer` is used for synthesis. As such if running
    this pass in a physical optimization stage (such as :ref:`transpiler-preset-stage-optimization`)
    this should be paired with passes such as :class:`.BasisTranslator` and/or
    :class:`.Optimize1qGatesDecomposition` to ensure that these errant single qubit
    gates are replaced with hardware supported operations prior to exiting the stage.

    This pass is multithreaded, and will perform the analysis in parallel
    and use all the cores available on your local system. You can refer to
    the `configuration guide <https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/guides/configure-qiskit-local>`__
    for details on how to control the threading behavior for Qiskit more broadly
    which will also control this pass

    This pass is similar in functionality to running :class:`.ConsolidateBlocks`
    and :class:`.UnitarySynthesis` sequentially in your pass manager. However,
    this pass offers improved runtime performance by performing the synthesis in
    parallel. It also has improved heuristics enabled by doing the optimization in
    a single step which can result in better quality output, especially in cases
    of overcomplete and/or heterogeneous targets. However, these heuristics and this
    pass as a whole are only valid for physical circuits. Additionally, unlike
    :class:`.UnitarySynthesis` pass this does not use :ref:`unitary-synth-plugin`.
    This is a tradeoff for performance and it forgoes the pluggability exposed
    via that interface. Internally it currently only uses the :class:`.TwoQubitBasisDecomposer`
    and :class:`.TwoQubitControlledUDecomposer` for synthesizing the two qubit unitaries.
    You should not use this pass if you need to use the pluggable interface and the ability
    to use different synthesis algorithms, instead you should use a combination of
    :class:`.ConsolidateBlocks` and :class:`.UnitarySynthesis` to leverage the plugin
    mechanism in :class:`.UnitarySynthesis`.
