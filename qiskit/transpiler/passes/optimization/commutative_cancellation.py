class CommutativeCancellation(TransformationPass):
    r"""Cancel self-adjoint gates and merge rotations by exploiting commutation relations.

    This pass uses commutation rules to apply the following optimizations
    to a sequence of gate:
    * **Self-inverse gates** (``h, y, cx, cy, cz``): if an even number of copies
      of the *same* self-inverse gate on the *same* qubit(s) commute together, they
      cancel completely; an odd number leaves a single copy behind.
    * **Same-axis rotations**: consecutive Z-rotations (``z, p, u1, rz, s, sdg, t, tdg``)
      or X-rotations (``x, rx, sx, sxdg``) on a qubit are summed into a single gate.
      A total angle that is a multiple of :math:`2\pi` removes all of them entirely
      (up to global phase), so inverse pairs like ``t`` + ``tdg`` cancel out naturally.

    Merging of Y-rotations is out of scope for this pass. Gates with symbolic
    (:class:`~.Parameter`) angles are also never merged.

    This pass is multithreaded and will potentially launch a thread pool with threads
    equal to the number of CPUs by default. Tune the number of threads with the
    ``RAYON_NUM_THREADS`` environment variable, e.g. ``RAYON_NUM_THREADS=4``.

    Example:
        the two ``cx`` gates below commute past the ``z`` gate (which acts
        only on the control qubit) and cancel each other, leaving just the ``z``::

        CommutativeCancellation initializer.

        Args:
            basis_gates (list[str]): Specifies which gate to use when writing back a
                merged same-axis rotation result, but only when the circuit itself does
                not already contain a suitable gate for that — the circuit always takes
                precedence over this list. For Z-rotations, the pass looks for ``rz``,
                ``p``, or ``u1``; if none of those is found in the circuit or in this
                list, Z-rotation merging is skipped entirely. For X-rotations, the pass
                looks for ``x`` or ``sx``; if neither is found, X-rotation merging still
                happens, just written as ``rx`` instead. Has no effect on which gates are
                eligible for cancellation in the first place; that set is fixed.
            target (Target): The :class:`~.Target` representing the target backend.
                Its operation names are extracted and used exactly like ``basis_gates``
                above — as a source of gate names for choosing the merged-rotation
                output gate. When both ``basis_gates`` and ``target`` are provided,
                ``target`` takes precedence and ``basis_gates`` is ignored entirely.
            approximation_degree: Threshold for treating two gates as commuting or
                cancelling even when they only do so approximately. It sets a
                tolerance of ``max(1e-12, 1 - approximation_degree)`` on the average
                gate fidelity between the two gate orderings; anything within that
                tolerance counts as commuting. The default, ``1.0``, means exact
                commutativity (up to floating-point rounding). Lowering it below
                ``1.0`` lets more gates be grouped and cancelled, at the cost of a
                small unitary error. This doesn't affect the separate, fixed check for
                whether a merged angle is close enough to 2π to drop.
