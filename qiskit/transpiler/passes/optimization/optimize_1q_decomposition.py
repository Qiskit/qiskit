    The decision to replace the original chain with a new resynthesis depends on:
     - whether the original chain was out of basis: replace
     - whether the original chain was in basis but resynthesis is lower error: replace
     - whether the original chain contains a pulse gate: do not replace
     - whether the original chain amounts to identity: replace with null
