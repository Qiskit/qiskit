    In more detail, this plugin is used to synthesize objects of type `PermutationGate`.
    When synthesis succeeds, the plugin outputs a quantum circuit consisting only of swap
    gates. When synthesis does not succeed, the plugin outputs `None`.

    If either `coupling_map` or `qubits` is None, then the synthesized circuit
    is not required to adhere to connectivity constraints, as is the case
    when the synthesis is done before layout/routing.

    On the other hand, if both `coupling_map` and `qubits` are specified, the synthesized
    circuit is supposed to adhere to connectivity constraints. At the moment, the
    plugin only creates swap gates between qubits in `qubits`, i.e. it does not use
    any other qubits in the coupling map (if such synthesis is not possible, the
    plugin  outputs `None`).

    The plugin supports the following plugin-specific options:

    * trials: The number of trials for the token swapper to perform the mapping. The
      circuit with the smallest number of SWAPs is returned.
    * seed: The argument to the token swapper specifying the seed for random trials.
    * parallel_threshold: The argument to the token swapper specifying the number of nodes
      in the graph beyond which the algorithm will use parallel processing.
