class TokenSwapperSynthesisPermutation(HighLevelSynthesisPlugin):
    """The permutation synthesis plugin based on the token swapper algorithm.

    This plugin name is :``permutation.token_swapper`` which can be used as the key on
    an :class:`~.HLSConfig` object to use this method with :class:`~.HighLevelSynthesis`.

    In more detail, this plugin is used to synthesize objects of type `PermutationGate`.
    When synthesis succeeds, the plugin outputs a quantum circuit consisting only of swap
    gates. When synthesis does not succeed, the plugin outputs `None`.

    If either `coupling_map` or `qubits` is None, then the synthesized circuit
    is not required to adhere to connectivity constraints, as is the case
    when the synthesis is done before layout/routing.

    On the other hand, if both `coupling_map` and `qubits` are specified, the synthesized
    circuit is supposed to adhere to connectivity constraints. At the moment, the
    plugin only creates swap gates between qubits in `qubits`, i.e. it does not use
    any other qubits in the coupling map (if such synthesis is not possible, the
    plugin  outputs `None`).

    The plugin supports the following plugin-specific options:

    * trials: The number of trials for the token swapper to perform the mapping. The
      circuit with the smallest number of SWAPs is returned.
    * seed: The argument to the token swapper specifying the seed for random trials.
    * parallel_threshold: The argument to the token swapper specifying the number of nodes
      in the graph beyond which the algorithm will use parallel processing.

    For more details on the token swapper algorithm, see to the paper:
    `arXiv:1902.09102 <https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09102>`__.
