class HLSConfig:
    """The high-level-synthesis config allows to specify a list of "methods" used by
    :class:`~.HighLevelSynthesis` transformation pass to synthesize different types
    of higher-level objects.

    A higher-level object is an object of type :class:`~.Operation` (e.g., :class:`.Clifford` or
    :class:`.LinearFunction`).  Each object is referred to by its :attr:`~.Operation.name` field
    (e.g., ``"clifford"`` for :class:`.Clifford` objects), and the applicable synthesis methods are
    tied to this name.

    In the config, each method is specified in one of several ways:

    1. a tuple consisting of the name of a known synthesis plugin and a dictionary providing
       additional arguments for the algorithm.
    2. a tuple consisting of an instance of :class:`.HighLevelSynthesisPlugin` and additional
       arguments for the algorithm.
    3. a single string of a known synthesis plugin
    4. a single instance of :class:`.HighLevelSynthesisPlugin`.

    The following example illustrates different ways how a config file can be created::

        from qiskit.transpiler.passes.synthesis.high_level_synthesis import HLSConfig
        from qiskit.transpiler.passes.synthesis.high_level_synthesis import ACGSynthesisPermutation

        # All the ways to specify hls_config are equivalent

        hls_config = HLSConfig(permutation=["acg"])
        hls_config = HLSConfig(permutation=[(ACGSynthesisPermutation(), {})])
        hls_config = HLSConfig(permutation=[ACGSynthesisPermutation()])

    The names of the synthesis plugins should be declared in ``entry-points`` table for
    ``qiskit.synthesis`` in ``pyproject.toml``, in the form
    <higher-level-object-name>.<synthesis-method-name>.

    The standard higher-level-objects are recommended to have a synthesis method
    called "default", which would be called automatically when synthesizing these objects,
    without having to explicitly set these methods in the config.

    To avoid synthesizing a given higher-level-object, one can give it an empty list of methods.

    For an explicit example of using such config files, refer to the documentation for
    :class:`~.HighLevelSynthesis`.

class HighLevelSynthesis(TransformationPass):
    r"""Synthesize higher-level objects and unroll custom definitions.

    The input to this pass is a DAG that may contain higher-level objects,
    including abstract mathematical objects (e.g., objects of type :class:`.LinearFunction`),
    annotated operations (objects of type :class:`.AnnotatedOperation`), and
    custom gates.

    In the most common use-case when either ``basis_gates`` or ``target`` is specified,
    all higher-level objects are synthesized, so the output is a :class:`.DAGCircuit`
    without such objects.
    More precisely, every gate in the output DAG is either directly supported by the target,
    or is in ``equivalence_library``.

    The abstract mathematical objects are synthesized using synthesis plugins, applying
    synthesis methods specified in the high-level-synthesis config (refer to the documentation
    for :class:`~.HLSConfig`).

    As an example, let us assume that ``op_a`` and ``op_b`` are names of two higher-level objects,
    that ``op_a``-objects have two synthesis methods ``default`` which does require any additional
    parameters and ``other`` with two optional integer parameters ``option_1`` and ``option_2``,
    that ``op_b``-objects have a single synthesis method ``default``, and ``qc`` is a quantum
    circuit containing ``op_a`` and ``op_b`` objects. The following code snippet::

        hls_config = HLSConfig(op_b=[("other", {"option_1": 7, "option_2": 4})])
        pm = PassManager([HighLevelSynthesis(hls_config=hls_config)])
        transpiled_qc = pm.run(qc)

    shows how to run the alternative synthesis method ``other`` for ``op_b``-objects, while using the
    ``default`` methods for all other high-level objects, including ``op_a``-objects.

    The annotated operations (consisting of a base operation and a list of inverse, control and power
    modifiers) are synthesizing recursively, first synthesizing the base operation, and then applying
    synthesis methods for creating inverted, controlled, or powered versions of that).

    The custom gates are synthesized by recursively unrolling their definitions, until every gate
    is either supported by the target or is in the equivalence library.

    When neither ``basis_gates`` nor ``target`` is specified, the pass synthesizes only the top-level
    abstract mathematical objects and annotated operations, without descending into the gate
    ``definitions``. This is consistent with the older behavior of the pass, allowing to synthesize
    some higher-level objects using plugins and leaving the other gates untouched.

    The high-level-synthesis passes information about available auxiliary qubits, and whether their
    state is clean (defined as :math:`|0\rangle`) or dirty (unknown state) to the synthesis routine
    via the respective arguments ``"num_clean_ancillas"`` and ``"num_dirty_ancillas"``.
    If ``qubits_initially_zero`` is ``True`` (default), the qubits are assumed to be in the
    :math:`|0\rangle` state. When appending a synthesized block using auxiliary qubits onto the
    circuit, we first use the clean auxiliary qubits.

    .. note::

        Synthesis methods are assumed to maintain the state of the auxiliary qubits.
        Concretely this means that clean auxiliary qubits must still be in the :math:`|0\rangle`
        state after the synthesized block, while dirty auxiliary qubits are re-used only
        as dirty qubits.
