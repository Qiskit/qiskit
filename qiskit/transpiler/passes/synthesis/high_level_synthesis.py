class HLSConfig:
    """The high-level-synthesis config allows to specify a list of "methods" used by
    :class:`~.HighLevelSynthesis` transformation pass to synthesize different types
    of higher-level objects.

    A higher-level object is an object of type :class:`~.Operation` (e.g., :class:`.Clifford` or
    :class:`.LinearFunction`).  Each object is referred to by its :attr:`~.Operation.name` field
    (e.g., ``"clifford"`` for :class:`.Clifford` objects), and the applicable synthesis methods are
    tied to this name.

    In the config, each method is specified in one of several ways:

    1. a tuple consisting of the name of a known synthesis plugin and a dictionary providing
       additional arguments for the algorithm.
    2. a tuple consisting of an instance of :class:`.HighLevelSynthesisPlugin` and additional
       arguments for the algorithm.
    3. a single string of a known synthesis plugin
    4. a single instance of :class:`.HighLevelSynthesisPlugin`.

    The following example illustrates different ways how a config file can be created::

        from qiskit.transpiler.passes.synthesis.high_level_synthesis import HLSConfig
        from qiskit.transpiler.passes.synthesis.high_level_synthesis import ACGSynthesisPermutation

        # All the ways to specify hls_config are equivalent
        hls_config = HLSConfig(permutation=[("acg", {})])
        hls_config = HLSConfig(permutation=["acg"])
        hls_config = HLSConfig(permutation=[(ACGSynthesisPermutation(), {})])
        hls_config = HLSConfig(permutation=[ACGSynthesisPermutation()])

    The names of the synthesis plugins should be declared in ``entry-points`` table for
    ``qiskit.synthesis`` in ``pyproject.toml``, in the form
    <higher-level-object-name>.<synthesis-method-name>.

    The standard higher-level-objects are recommended to have a synthesis method
    called "default", which would be called automatically when synthesizing these objects,
    without having to explicitly set these methods in the config.

    To avoid synthesizing a given higher-level-object, one can give it an empty list of methods.

    For an explicit example of using such config files, refer to the documentation for
    :class:`~.HighLevelSynthesis`.

    :ref:`using-high-level-synthesis-plugins`.

class HighLevelSynthesis(TransformationPass):
    """Synthesize higher-level objects and unroll custom definitions.

    The input to this pass is a DAG that may contain higher-level objects,
    including abstract mathematical objects (e.g., objects of type :class:`.LinearFunction`),
    annotated operations (objects of type :class:`.AnnotatedOperation`), and
    custom gates.

    In the most common use-case when either ``basis_gates`` or ``target`` is specified,
    all higher-level objects are synthesized, so the output is a :class:`.DAGCircuit`
    without such objects.
    More precisely, every gate in the output DAG is either directly supported by the target,
    or is in ``equivalence_library``.

    The abstract mathematical objects are synthesized using synthesis plugins, applying
    synthesis methods specified in the high-level-synthesis config (refer to the documentation
    for :class:`~.HLSConfig`).

    As an example, let us assume that ``op_a`` and ``op_b`` are names of two higher-level objects,
    that ``op_a``-objects have two synthesis methods ``default`` which does require any additional
    parameters and ``other`` with two optional integer parameters ``option_1`` and ``option_2``,
    that ``op_b``-objects have a single synthesis method ``default``, and ``qc`` is a quantum
    circuit containing ``op_a`` and ``op_b`` objects. The following code snippet::

        hls_config = HLSConfig(op_b=[("other", {"option_1": 7, "option_2": 4})])
        pm = PassManager([HighLevelSynthesis(hls_config=hls_config)])
        transpiled_qc = pm.run(qc)

    shows how to run the alternative synthesis method ``other`` for ``op_b``-objects, while using the
    ``default`` methods for all other high-level objects, including ``op_a``-objects.

    The annotated operations (consisting of a base operation and a list of inverse, control and power
    modifiers) are synthesizing recursively, first synthesizing the base operation, and then applying
    synthesis methods for creating inverted, controlled, or powered versions of that).

    The custom gates are synthesized by recursively unrolling their definitions, until every gate
    is either supported by the target or is in the equivalence library.

    When neither ``basis_gates`` nor ``target`` is specified, the pass synthesizes only the top-level
    abstract mathematical objects and annotated operations, without descending into the gate
    ``definitions``. This is consistent with the older behavior of the pass, allowing to synthesize
    some higher-level objects using plugins and leaving the other gates untouched.

class TokenSwapperSynthesisPermutation(HighLevelSynthesisPlugin):
    """The permutation synthesis plugin based on the token swapper algorithm.

    This plugin name is :``permutation.token_swapper`` which can be used as the key on
    an :class:`~.HLSConfig` object to use this method with :class:`~.HighLevelSynthesis`.

    In more detail, this plugin is used to synthesize objects of type `PermutationGate`.
    When synthesis succeeds, the plugin outputs a quantum circuit consisting only of swap
    gates. When synthesis does not succeed, the plugin outputs `None`.

    If either `coupling_map` or `qubits` is None, then the synthesized circuit
    is not required to adhere to connectivity constraints, as is the case
    when the synthesis is done before layout/routing.

    On the other hand, if both `coupling_map` and `qubits` are specified, the synthesized
    circuit is supposed to adhere to connectivity constraints. At the moment, the
    plugin only creates swap gates between qubits in `qubits`, i.e. it does not use
    any other qubits in the coupling map (if such synthesis is not possible, the
    plugin  outputs `None`).

    The plugin supports the following plugin-specific options:

    * trials: The number of trials for the token swapper to perform the mapping. The
      circuit with the smallest number of SWAPs is returned.
    * seed: The argument to the token swapper specifying the seed for random trials.
    * parallel_threshold: The argument to the token swapper specifying the number of nodes
      in the graph beyond which the algorithm will use parallel processing.

    For more details on the token swapper algorithm, see to the paper:
    `arXiv:1902.09102 <https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09102>`__.
