    """The high-level-synthesis config allows to specify a list of "methods" used by
    :class:`~.HighLevelSynthesis` transformation pass to synthesize different types
    of higher-level-objects. A higher-level object is an object of type
    :class:`~.Operation` (e.g., "clifford", "linear_function", etc.), and the list
    of applicable synthesis methods is strictly tied to the name of the operation.
    In the config, each method is specified as a tuple consisting of the name of the
    synthesis algorithm and of a dictionary providing additional arguments for this
    algorithm. Additionally, a synthesis method can be specified as a tuple consisting
    of an instance of :class:`.HighLevelSynthesisPlugin` and additional arguments.
    Moreover, when there are no additional arguments, a synthesis
    method can be specified simply by name or by an instance
    of :class:`.HighLevelSynthesisPlugin`. The following example illustrates different
    ways how a config file can be created::

        from qiskit.transpiler.passes.synthesis.high_level_synthesis import HLSConfig
        from qiskit.transpiler.passes.synthesis.high_level_synthesis import ACGSynthesisPermutation

        hls_config = HLSConfig(permutation=[(ACGSynthesisPermutation(), {})])
        hls_config = HLSConfig(permutation=[ACGSynthesisPermutation()])

    The names of the synthesis algorithms should be declared in ``entry_points`` for
    ``qiskit.synthesis`` in ``setup.py``, in the form
    <higher-level-object-name>.<synthesis-method-name>.

    The standard higher-level-objects are recommended to have a synthesis method
    called "default", which would be called automatically when synthesizing these objects,
    without having to explicitly set these methods in the config.

    To avoid synthesizing a given higher-level-object, one can give it an empty list of methods.

    For an explicit example of using such config files, refer to the
    documentation for :class:`~.HighLevelSynthesis`.

    The input to this pass is a DAG that may contain higher-level objects,
    including abstract mathematical objects (e.g., objects of type :class:`.LinearFunction`)
    and annotated operations (objects of type :class:`.AnnotatedOperation`).
    By default, all higher-level objects are synthesized, so the output is a DAG without such objects.

    The abstract mathematical objects are synthesized using synthesis plugins, applying
    synthesis methods specified in the high-level-synthesis config (refer to the documentation
    for :class:`~.HLSConfig`).

    As an example, let us assume that ``op_a`` and ``op_b`` are names of two higher-level objects,
    that ``op_a``-objects have two synthesis methods ``default`` which does require any additional
    parameters and ``other`` with two optional integer parameters ``option_1`` and ``option_2``,
    that ``op_b``-objects have a single synthesis method ``default``, and ``qc`` is a quantum
    circuit containing ``op_a`` and ``op_b`` objects. The following code snippet::

        hls_config = HLSConfig(op_b=[("other", {"option_1": 7, "option_2": 4})])
        pm = PassManager([HighLevelSynthesis(hls_config=hls_config)])
        transpiled_qc = pm.run(qc)

    shows how to run the alternative synthesis method ``other`` for ``op_b``-objects, while using the
    ``default`` methods for all other high-level objects, including ``op_a``-objects.

    The annotated operations (consisting of a base operation and a list of inverse, control and power
    modifiers) are synthesizing recursively, first synthesizing the base operation, and then applying
    synthesis methods for creating inverted, controlled, or powered versions of that).
