    of higher-level-objects. A higher-level object is an object of type
    :class:`~.Operation` (e.g., "clifford", "linear_function", etc.), and the list
    of applicable synthesis methods is strictly tied to the name of the operation.
    In the config, each method is represented by a pair consisting of a name of the synthesis
    algorithm and of a dictionary providing additional arguments for this algorithm.

    The names of the synthesis algorithms should be declared in ``entry_points`` for
    ``qiskit.synthesis`` in ``setup.py``, in the form
    <higher-level-object-name>.<synthesis-method-name>.

    The standard higher-level-objects are recommended to have a synthesis method
    called "default", which would be called automatically when synthesizing these objects,
    without having to explicitly set these methods in the config.

    To avoid synthesizing a given higher-level-object, one can give it an empty list of methods.

    For an explicit example of creating and using such config files, refer to the
    documentation for :class:`~.HighLevelSynthesis`.
