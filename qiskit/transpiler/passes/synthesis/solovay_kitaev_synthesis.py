    r"""Approximately decompose 1q gates to a discrete basis using the Solovay-Kitaev algorithm.

    The Solovay-Kitaev theorem [1] states that any single qubit gate can be approximated to
    arbitrary precision by a set of fixed single-qubit gates, if the set generates a dense
    subset in :math:`SU(2)`. This is an important result, since it means that any single-qubit
    gate can be expressed in terms of a discrete, universal gate set that we know how to implement
    fault-tolerantly. Therefore, the Solovay-Kitaev algorithm allows us to take any
    non-fault tolerant circuit and rephrase it in a fault-tolerant manner.

    This implementation of the Solovay-Kitaev algorithm is based on [2].

    For example, the following circuit

    .. code-block:: text

             ┌─────────┐
        q_0: ┤ RX(0.8) ├
             └─────────┘

    can be decomposed into

    .. code-block:: text

        global phase: 7π/8
             ┌───┐┌───┐┌───┐
        q_0: ┤ H ├┤ T ├┤ H ├
             └───┘└───┘└───┘

    with an L2-error of approximately 0.01.

    Examples:

        Per default, the basis gate set is ``["t", "tdg", "h"]``:

        .. plot::
           :include-source:

            print(circuit.draw())

            skd = SolovayKitaev(recursion_degree=2)

            discretized = skd(circuit)

            print("Discretized circuit:")
            print(discretized.draw())

            print("Error:", np.linalg.norm(Operator(circuit).data - Operator(discretized).data))

        .. code-block:: text

            Original circuit:
               ┌─────────┐
