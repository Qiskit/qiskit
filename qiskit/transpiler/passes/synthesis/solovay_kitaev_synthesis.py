    """
    An Solovay-Kitaev-based Qiskit unitary synthesis plugin.

    This plugin is invoked by :func:`~.compiler.transpile` when the ``unitary_synthesis_method``
    parameter is set to ``"sk"``.

    This plugin supports customization and additional parameters can be passed to the plugin
    by passing a dictionary as the ``unitary_synthesis_plugin_config`` parameter of
    the :func:`~qiskit.compiler.transpile` function.

    Supported parameters in the dictionary:

    network_layout (str)
        Type of network geometry, one of {``"sequ"``, ``"spin"``, ``"cart"``, ``"cyclic_spin"``,
        ``"cyclic_line"``}. Default value is ``"spin"``.

    connectivity_type (str)
        type of inter-qubit connectivity, {``"full"``, ``"line"``, ``"star"``}.  Default value
        is ``"full"``.

    depth (int)
        depth of the CNOT-network, i.e. the number of layers, where each layer consists of a
        single CNOT-block.

    optimizer (:class:`~qiskit.algorithms.optimizers.Optimizer`)
        An instance of optimizer to be used in the optimization process.

    seed (int)
        A random seed.

    initial_point (:class:`~numpy.ndarray`)
        Initial values of angles/parameters to start the optimization process from.
