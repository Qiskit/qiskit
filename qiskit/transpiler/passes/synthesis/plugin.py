Synthesis Plugins (:mod:`qiskit.transpiler.passes.synthesis.plugin`)
====================================================================

.. currentmodule:: qiskit.transpiler.passes.synthesis.plugin

This module defines the plugin interfaces for the synthesis transpiler passes
in Qiskit. These provide a hook point for external python packages to implement
their own synthesis techniques and have them seamlessly exposed as opt-in
options to users when they run :func:`~qiskit.compiler.transpile`.

The plugin interfaces are built using setuptools
`entry points <https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/userguide/entry_point.html>`__
which enable packages external to qiskit to advertise they include a synthesis
plugin.

See :mod:`qiskit.transpiler.preset_passmanagers.plugin` for details on how
to write plugins for transpiler stages.

Writing Plugins
===============

Unitary Synthesis Plugins
-------------------------

To write a unitary synthesis plugin there are 2 main steps. The first step is
to create a subclass of the abstract plugin class:
:class:`~qiskit.transpiler.passes.synthesis.plugin.UnitarySynthesisPlugin`.
The plugin class defines the interface and contract for unitary synthesis
plugins. The primary method is
:meth:`~qiskit.transpiler.passes.synthesis.plugin.UnitarySynthesisPlugin.run`
which takes in a single positional argument, a unitary matrix as a numpy array,
and is expected to return a :class:`~qiskit.dagcircuit.DAGCircuit` object
representing the synthesized circuit from that unitary matrix. Then to inform
the Qiskit transpiler about what information is necessary for the pass there
are several required property methods that need to be implemented such as
``supports_basis_gates`` and ``supports_coupling_map`` depending on whether the
plugin supports and/or requires that input to perform synthesis. For the full
details refer to the
:class:`~qiskit.transpiler.passes.synthesis.plugin.UnitarySynthesisPlugin`
documentation for all the required fields. An example plugin class would look
something like::

    from qiskit.transpiler.passes.synthesis import plugin
    from qiskit_plugin_pkg.synthesis import generate_dag_circuit_from_matrix


    class SpecialUnitarySynthesis(plugin.UnitarySynthesisPlugin):
        @property
        def supports_basis_gates(self):
            return True

        @property
        def supports_coupling_map(self):
            return False

        @property
        def supports_natural_direction(self):
            return False

        @property
        def supports_pulse_optimize(self):
            return False

        @property
        def supports_gate_lengths(self):
            return False

        @property
        def supports_gate_errors(self):
            return False

        @property
        def supports_gate_lengths_by_qubit(self):
            return False

        @property
        def supports_gate_errors_by_qubit(self):
            return False

        @property
        def min_qubits(self):
            return None

        @property
        def max_qubits(self):
            return None

        @property
        def supported_bases(self):
            return None

        def run(self, unitary, **options):
            basis_gates = options['basis_gates']
            dag_circuit = generate_dag_circuit_from_matrix(unitary, basis_gates)
            return dag_circuit

If for some reason the available inputs to the
:meth:`~qiskit.transpiler.passes.synthesis.plugin.UnitarySynthesisPlugin.run`
method are insufficient please open an issue and we can discuss expanding the
plugin interface with new opt-in inputs that can be added in a backwards
compatible manner for future releases. Do note though that this plugin interface
is considered stable and guaranteed to not change in a breaking manner. If
changes are needed (for example to expand the available optional input options)
it will be done in a way that will **not** require changes from existing
plugins.

.. note::

    All methods prefixed with ``supports_`` are reserved on a
    ``UnitarySynthesisPlugin`` derived class for part of the interface. You
    should not define any custom ``supports_*`` methods on a subclass that
    are not defined in the abstract class.


The second step is to expose the
:class:`~qiskit.transpiler.passes.synthesis.plugin.UnitarySynthesisPlugin` as
a setuptools entry point in the package metadata. This is done by simply adding
an ``entry-points`` table in ``pyproject.toml`` for the plugin package with the necessary entry
points under the ``qiskit.unitary_synthesis`` namespace. For example:

.. code-block:: toml

    [project.entry-points."qiskit.unitary_synthesis"]
    "special" = "qiskit_plugin_pkg.module.plugin:SpecialUnitarySynthesis"

There isn't a limit to the number of plugins a single package can
include as long as each plugin has a unique name. So a single package can
expose multiple plugins if necessary. The name ``default`` is used by Qiskit
itself and can't be used in a plugin.

Unitary Synthesis Plugin Configuration
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

For some unitary synthesis plugins that expose multiple options and tunables
the plugin interface has an option for users to provide a free form
configuration dictionary. This will be passed through to the ``run()`` method
as the ``options`` kwarg. If your plugin has these configuration options you
should clearly document how a user should specify these configuration options
and how they're used as it's a free form field.

High-Level Synthesis Plugins
----------------------------

Writing a high-level synthesis plugin is conceptually similar to writing a
unitary synthesis plugin. The first step is to create a subclass of the
abstract plugin class:
:class:`~qiskit.transpiler.passes.synthesis.plugin.HighLevelSynthesisPlugin`,
which defines the interface and contract for high-level synthesis plugins.
The primary method is
:meth:`~qiskit.transpiler.passes.synthesis.plugin.HighLevelSynthesisPlugin.run`.
The positional argument ``high_level_object`` specifies the "higher-level-object" to
be synthesized, which is any object of type :class:`~qiskit.circuit.Operation`
(including, for example,
:class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.generalized_gates.linear_function.LinearFunction` or
:class:`~qiskit.quantum_info.operators.symplectic.clifford.Clifford`).
The keyword argument ``target`` specifies the target backend, allowing the plugin
to access all target-specific information,
such as the coupling map, the supported gate set, and so on. The keyword argument
``coupling_map`` only specifies the coupling map, and is only used when ``target``
is not specified.
The keyword argument ``qubits`` specifies the list of qubits over which the
higher-level-object is defined, in case the synthesis is done on the physical circuit.
The value of ``None`` indicates that the layout has not yet been chosen and the physical qubits
in the target or coupling map that this operation is operating on has not yet been determined.
Additionally, plugin-specific options and tunables can be specified via ``options``,
which is a free form configuration dictionary.
If your plugin has these configuration options you
should clearly document how a user should specify these configuration options
and how they're used as it's a free form field.
The method
:meth:`~qiskit.transpiler.passes.synthesis.plugin.HighLevelSynthesisPlugin.run`
is expected to return a :class:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit` object
representing the synthesized circuit from that higher-level-object.
It is also allowed to return ``None`` representing that the synthesis method is
unable to synthesize the given higher-level-object.
The actual synthesis of higher-level objects is performed by
:class:`~qiskit.transpiler.passes.synthesis.high_level_synthesis.HighLevelSynthesis`
transpiler pass.
For the full details refer to the
:class:`~qiskit.transpiler.passes.synthesis.plugin.HighLevelSynthesisPlugin`
documentation for all the required fields. An example plugin class would look
something like::

    from qiskit.transpiler.passes.synthesis.plugin import HighLevelSynthesisPlugin
    from qiskit.synthesis.clifford import synth_clifford_bm


    class SpecialSynthesisClifford(HighLevelSynthesisPlugin):

    def run(self, high_level_object, coupling_map=None, target=None, qubits=None, **options):
        if higher_level_object.num_qubits <= 3:
            return synth_clifford_bm(high_level_object)
        else:
            return None

The above example creates a plugin to synthesize objects of type
:class:`.Clifford` that have
at most 3 qubits, using the method ``synth_clifford_bm``.

The second step is to expose the
:class:`~qiskit.transpiler.passes.synthesis.plugin.HighLevelSynthesisPlugin` as
a setuptools entry point in the package metadata. This is done by adding
an ``entry-points`` table in ``pyproject.toml`` for the plugin package with the necessary entry
points under the ``qiskit.synthesis`` namespace. For example:

.. code-block:: toml

    [project.entry-points."qiskit.synthesis"]
    "clifford.special" = "qiskit_plugin_pkg.module.plugin:SpecialSynthesisClifford"

The ``name`` consists of two parts separated by dot ".": the name of the
type of :class:`~qiskit.circuit.Operation` to which the synthesis plugin applies
(``clifford``), and the name of the plugin (``special``).
There isn't a limit to the number of plugins a single package can
include as long as each plugin has a unique name.

Using Plugins
=============

Unitary Synthesis Plugins
-------------------------

To use a plugin all you need to do is install the package that includes a
synthesis plugin. Then Qiskit will automatically discover the installed
plugins and expose them as valid options for the appropriate
:func:`~qiskit.compiler.transpile` kwargs and pass constructors. If there are
any installed plugins which can't be loaded/imported this will be logged to
Python logging.

To get the installed list of installed unitary synthesis plugins you can use the
:func:`qiskit.transpiler.passes.synthesis.plugin.unitary_synthesis_plugin_names`
function.

.. _using-high-level-synthesis-plugins:

High-level Synthesis Plugins
----------------------------

To use a high-level synthesis plugin, you first instantiate an :class:`.HLSConfig` to
store the names of the plugins to use for various high-level objects.
For example::

    HLSConfig(permutation=["acg"], clifford=["layers"], linear_function=["pmh"])

creates a high-level synthesis configuration that uses the ``acg`` plugin
for synthesizing :class:`.PermutationGate` objects, the ``layers`` plugin
for synthesizing :class:`.Clifford` objects, and the ``pmh`` plugin for synthesizing
:class:`.LinearFunction` objects.  The keyword arguments are the :attr:`.Operation.name` fields of
the relevant objects.  For example, all :class:`.Clifford` operations have the
:attr:`~.Operation.name` ``clifford``, so this is used as the keyword argument.  You can specify
any keyword argument here that you have installed plugins to handle, including custom user objects
if you have plugins installed for them.  See :class:`.HLSConfig` for more detail on alternate
formats for configuring the plugins within each argument.

For each high-level object, the list of given plugins are tried in sequence until one of them
succeeds (in the example above, each list only contains a single plugin). In addition to specifying
a plugin by its name, you can instead pass a ``(name, options)`` tuple, where the second element of
the tuple is a dictionary containing options for the plugin.

Once created you then pass this :class:`.HLSConfig` object into the
``hls_config`` argument for :func:`.transpile` or :func:`.generate_preset_pass_manager`
which will use the specified plugins as part of the larger compilation workflow.

To get a list of installed high level synthesis plugins for any given :attr:`.Operation.name`, you
can use the :func:`.high_level_synthesis_plugin_names` function, passing the desired ``name`` as the
argument::

    high_level_synthesis_plugin_names("clifford")

will return a list of all the installed Clifford synthesis plugins.

Available Plugins
=================

High-level synthesis plugins that are directly available in Qiskit include plugins
for synthesizing :class:`.Clifford` objects, :class:`.LinearFunction` objects, and
:class:`.PermutationGate` objects.
Some of these plugins implicitly target all-to-all connectivity. This is not a
practical limitation since
:class:`~qiskit.transpiler.passes.synthesis.high_level_synthesis.HighLevelSynthesis`
typically runs before layout and routing, which will ensure that the final circuit
adheres to the device connectivity by inserting additional SWAP gates. A good example
is the permutation synthesis plugin ``ACGSynthesisPermutation`` which can synthesize
any permutation with at most 2 layers of SWAP gates.
On the other hand, some plugins implicitly target linear connectivity.
Typically, the synthesizing circuits have larger depth and the number of gates,
however no additional SWAP gates would be inserted if the following layout pass chose a
consecutive line of qubits inside the topology of the device. A good example of this is
the permutation synthesis plugin ``KMSSynthesisPermutation`` which can synthesize any
permutation of ``n`` qubits in depth ``n``. Typically, it is difficult to know in advance
which of the two approaches: synthesizing circuits for all-to-all connectivity and
inserting SWAP gates vs. synthesizing circuits for linear connectivity and inserting less
or no SWAP gates lead a better final circuit, so it likely makes sense to try both and
see which gives better results.
Finally, some plugins can target a given connectivity, and hence should be run after the
layout is set. In this case the synthesized circuit automatically adheres to
the topology of the device. A good example of this is the permutation synthesis plugin
``TokenSwapperSynthesisPermutation`` which is able to synthesize arbitrary permutations
with respect to arbitrary coupling maps.
For more detail, please refer to description of each individual plugin.

Below are the synthesis plugin classes available in Qiskit. These classes should not be
used directly, but instead should be used through the plugin interface documented
above. The classes are listed here to ease finding the documentation for each of the
included plugins and to ease the comparison between different synthesis methods for
a given object.

High Level Synthesis
--------------------

For each high-level object we give a table that lists all of its plugins available
directly in Qiskit. We include the name of the plugin, the class of the plugin,
the targeted connectivity map and optionally additional information. Recall the plugins
should be used via the previously described :class:`.HLSConfig`, for example::

    HLSConfig(permutation=["kms"])

creates a high-level synthesis configuration that uses the ``kms`` plugin
for synthesizing :class:`.PermutationGate` objects -- i.e. those with
``name = "permutation"``. In this case, the plugin name is "kms", the plugin class
is :class:`~.KMSSynthesisPermutation`. This particular synthesis algorithm created
a circuit adhering to the linear nearest-neighbor connectivity.

            a tuple of the form ``(dag, wires)`` where ``dag`` is the dag circuit representation of
