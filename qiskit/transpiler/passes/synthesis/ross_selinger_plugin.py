    """A Ross-Selinger Qiskit unitary synthesis plugin.

    The algorithm is described in [1]. The source code (in Rust) is available at
    https://github.com/qiskit-community/rsgridsynth.

    This plugin is invoked by :func:`~.compiler.transpile` when the ``unitary_synthesis_method``
    parameter is set to ``"rs"``.

    This plugin supports customization and additional parameters can be passed to the plugin
    by passing a dictionary as the ``unitary_synthesis_plugin_config`` parameter of
    the :func:`~qiskit.compiler.transpile` function.

    Supported parameters in the dictionary:

    epsilon (f64):
        The allowed approximation error.
