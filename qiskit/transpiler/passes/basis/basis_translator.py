class BasisTranslator(TransformationPass):
    """Translates gates to a target basis by searching for a set of translations
    from a given EquivalenceLibrary.

    This pass operates in several steps:

    * Determine the source basis from the input circuit.
    * Perform a Dijkstra search over basis sets, starting from the device's
      target_basis new gates are being generated using the rules from the provided
      EquivalenceLibrary and the search stops if all gates in the source basis have
      been generated.
    * The found path, as a set of rules from the EquivalenceLibrary, is composed
      into a set of gate replacement rules.
    * The composed replacement rules are applied in-place to each op node which
      is not already in the target_basis.

    If the target keyword argument is specified and that
    :class:`~qiskit.transpiler.Target` objects contains operations
    which are non-global (i.e. they are defined only for a subset of qubits),
    as calculated by :meth:`~qiskit.transpiler.Target.get_non_global_operation_names`,
    this pass will attempt to match the output translation to those constraints.
    For 1 qubit operations this is straightforward, the pass will perform a
    search using the union of the set of global operations with the set of operations
    defined solely on that qubit. For multi-qubit gates this is a bit more involved,
    while the behavior is initially similar to the single qubit case, just using all
    the qubits the operation is run on (where order is not significant) isn't sufficient.
    We also need to consider any potential local qubits defined on subsets of the
    quantum arguments for the multi-qubit operation. This means the target used for the
    search of a non-global multi-qubit gate is the union of global operations, non-global
    multi-qubit gates sharing the same qubits, and any non-global gates defined on
    any subset of the qubits used.


    .. note::

        In the case of non-global operations it is possible for a single
        execution of this pass to output an incomplete translation if any
        non-global gates are defined on qubits that are a subset of a larger
        multi-qubit gate. For example, if you have a ``u`` gate only defined on
        qubit 0 and an ``x`` gate only on qubit 1 it is possible when
        translating a 2 qubit operation on qubit 0 and 1 that the output might
        have ``u`` on qubit 1 and ``x`` on qubit 0. Typically running this pass
        a second time will correct these issues.

    .. _translation_errors:

    Translation Errors
    ------------------

    This pass will error if there is no path to translate an input gate to
    the specified basis. However, during a typical/default preset passmanager
    this pass gets run multiple times at different stages of the compilation
    pipeline. This means that potentially the input gates that are getting
    translated were not in the input circuit to :func:`~.transpile` as they
    were generated by an intermediate transform in the circuit.

    When this error occurs it typically means that either the target basis
    is not universal or there are additional equivalence rules needed in the
    :class:`~.EquivalenceLibrary` instance being used by the
    :class:`~.BasisTranslator` pass. You can refer to
    :ref:`custom_basis_gates` for details on adding custom equivalence rules.
