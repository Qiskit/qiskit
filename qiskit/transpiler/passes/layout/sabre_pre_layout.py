    """Choose a starting layout to use for additional Sabre layout trials.

    The pass works by augmenting the coupling map with more and more "extra" edges
    until VF2 succeeds to find a perfect graph isomorphism. More precisely, the
    augmented coupling map contains edges between nodes that are within a given
    distance ``d`` in the original coupling map. The original edges are noise-free
    while the additional edges have noise that scales exponentially with the distance.
    The value of ``d`` is increased until an isomorphism is found.

    Intuitively, a better VF2 layout involves fewer and of shorter-distance extra edges.

        Args:
            coupling_map: Directed graph representing the original coupling map or a target modelling
                the backend (including its connectivity).
            max_distance: The maximum distance for running VF2 with the augmented coupling
                map. In particular, this also specifies the maximum distance between the original nodes
                that become connected in the augmented coupling map.
            error_rate: The error rate to assign to the "extra" edges. A non-zero
                error rate prioritizes VF2 to choose original edges over extra edges.
            max_trials_vf2: Specifies the maximum number of VF2 trials. This option remains primarily
                for legacy reasons since the introduction of on-the-fly scoring in VF2, which was
                introduced in Qiskit 2.3. To bound the time for the pass, set parameters ``max_distance``
                and ``call_limit_vf2`` instead.
            call_limit_vf2: The maximum number of times that the inner VF2 isomorphism search will
                attempt to extend the mapping. If ``None``, then no limit.  If a 2-tuple, then the
                limit starts as the first item, and swaps to the second after the first match is found,
                without resetting the number of steps taken.  This can be used to allow a long search
                for any mapping, but still terminate quickly with a small extension budget if one is
                found.
            improve_layout: Unused (the option became obsolete with the introduction of on-the-fly
                scoring in VF2).
            min_distance: The distance for the first VF2 run with the augmented coupling map. Setting
                ``min_distance > 1`` skips all smaller-distance checks, and in particular skips the
                distance-1 check which corresponds to running the ``VF2Layout`` pass.
