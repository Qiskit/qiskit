    Only barriers which can be merged without affecting the barrier structure

    Not all redundant barriers will necessarily be merged, only adjacent
    barriers are merged.

    For example, the circuit::

        qr = QuantumRegister(3, 'q')
        circuit = QuantumCircuit(qr)
        circuit.barrier(qr[0])
        circuit.barrier(qr[1])

    Will be transformed into a circuit corresponding to::

        circuit.barrier(qr[0])
        circuit.barrier(qr)

    after one iteration of the pass. These two barriers were not merged by the
    first pass as they are not adjacent in the initial circuit.

    The pass then can be reapplied to merge the newly adjacent barriers.
