                    Beware that the keyword arguments here are different to those used by the
                    generic :class:`.BasePassManager`.  This pass manager will translate those
                    arguments into the form described above.

                The exact arguments pass expose the internals of the pass
                manager and are subject to change as the pass manager internals
                change. If you intend to reuse a callback function over
                multiple releases be sure to check that the arguments being
                passed are the same.

                To use the callback feature you define a function that will
                take in kwargs dict and access the variables. For example::

                    def callback_func(**kwargs):
                        pass_ = kwargs['pass_']
                        dag = kwargs['dag']

                        property_set = kwargs['property_set']
                        count = kwargs['count']
                        ...
            num_processes: The maximum number of parallel processes to launch if parallel
                execution is enabled. This argument overrides ``num_processes`` in the user
                configuration file, and the ``QISKIT_NUM_PROCS`` environment variable. If set
                to ``None`` the system default or local user configuration will be used.

class StagedPassManager(PassManager):
    """A pass manager pipeline built from individual stages.

    This class enables building a compilation pipeline out of fixed stages.
    Each ``StagedPassManager`` defines a list of stages which are executed in
    a fixed order, and each stage is defined as a standalone :class:`~.PassManager`
    instance. There are also ``pre_`` and ``post_`` stages for each defined stage.
    This enables easily composing and replacing different stages and also adding
    hook points to enable programmatic modifications to a pipeline. When using a staged
    pass manager you are not able to modify the individual passes and are only able
    to modify stages.

    By default, instances of ``StagedPassManager`` define a typical full compilation
    pipeline from an abstract virtual circuit to one that is optimized and
    capable of running on the specified backend. The default pre-defined stages are:

    #. ``init`` - Initial passes to run before embedding the circuit to the backend.
    #. ``layout`` - Maps the virtual qubits in the circuit to the physical qubits on
       the backend.
    #. ``routing`` - Inserts gates as needed to move the qubit states around until
       the circuit can be run with the chosen layout on the backend's coupling map.
    #. ``translation`` - Translates the gates in the circuit to the target backend's
       basis gate set.
    #. ``optimization`` - Optimizes the circuit to reduce the cost of executing it.
       These passes will typically run in a loop until a convergence criteria is met.
       For example, the convergence criteria might be that the circuit depth does not
       decrease in successive iterations.
    #. ``scheduling`` - Hardware-aware passes that schedule the operations in the
       circuit.

    .. note::

        For backwards compatibility the relative positioning of these default
        stages will remain stable moving forward. However, new stages may be
        added to the default stage list in between current stages. For example,
        in a future release a new phase, something like ``logical_optimization``, could be added
        immediately after the existing ``init`` stage in the default stage list.
        This would preserve compatibility for pre-existing ``StagedPassManager``
        users as the relative positions of the stage are preserved so the behavior
        will not change between releases.

    These stages will be executed in order and any stage set to ``None`` will be skipped.
    If a stage is provided multiple times (i.e. at diferent relative positions), the
    associated passes, including pre and post, will run once per declaration.
    If a :class:`~qiskit.transpiler.PassManager` input is being used for more than 1 stage here
    (for example in the case of a :class:`~.Pass` that covers both Layout and Routing) you will
    want to set that to the earliest stage in sequence that it covers.
