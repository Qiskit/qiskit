"""
Directed graph object for representing coupling between physical qubits.

The nodes of the graph correspond to physical qubits (represented as integers) and the
directed edges indicate which physical qubits are coupled and the permitted direction of
CNOT gates. The object has a distance function that can be used to map quantum circuits
onto a device with this coupling.
