Drawing objects for pulse drawer.

Drawing objects play two important roles:
    - Allowing unittests of visualization module. Usually it is hard for image files to be tested.
    - Removing program parser from each plotter interface. We can easily add new plotter.

This module is based on the structure of matplotlib as it is the primary plotter
of the pulse drawer. However this interface is agnostic to the actual plotter.

Design concept
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When we think about dynamically updating drawing objects, it will be most efficient to
update only the changed properties of drawings rather than regenerating entirely from scratch.
Thus the core drawing function generates all possible drawings in the beginning and
then updates the visibility and the offset coordinate of each item according to
the end-user request.

Data key
~~~~~~~~
In the abstract class ``ElementaryData`` common properties to represent a drawing object are
specified. In addition, drawing objects have the `data_key` property that returns an
unique hash of the object for comparison. This property should be defined in each sub-class by
considering necessary properties to identify that object, i.e. `visible` should not
be a part of the key, because any change on this property just sets the visibility of
the same drawing object.

To support not only `matplotlib` but also multiple plotters, those drawing objectss should be
universal and designed without strong dependency on modules in `matplotlib`.
This means drawing objects that represent primitive geometries are preferred.
It should be noted that there will be no unittest for a plotter interface, which takes
drawing objects and output an image data, we should avoid adding a complicated data structure
that has a context of the pulse program.

For example, a pulse envelope is complex valued number array and may be represented
by two lines with different colors associated with the real and the imaginary component.
In this case, we can use two line-type objects rather than defining a new drwaing object
that takes complex value. Because many plotters don't support an API that visualizes
complex valued data array. If we introduce such drawing object and write a custom wrapper function
on top of the existing plotter API, it could be difficult to prevent bugs with the CI tools
due to lack of the effective unittest.
