Special data types.


- PhaseFreqTuple:
    Data set to represent a pair of floating values associated with a
    phase and frequency of the frame of channel.

    phase: Floating value associated with phase.
    freq: Floating value associated with frequency.

- InstructionTuple:
    Type for representing instruction objects to draw.

    Waveform and Frame type instructions are internally converted into this data format and
    fed to the object generators.

    t0: The time when this instruction is issued. This value is in units of cycle time dt.
    dt: Time resolution of this system.
    frame: `PhaseFreqTuple` object to represent the frame of this instruction.
    inst: Pulse instruction object.

- NonPulseTuple:
    Data set to generate drawing objects.

    Special instructions such as snapshot and relative barriers are internally converted
    into this data format and fed to the object generators.

    t0: The time when this instruction is issued. This value is in units of cycle time dt.
    dt: Time resolution of this system.
    inst: Pulse instruction object.

- ChannelTuple:
    Data set to generate drawing objects.

    Channel information is internally represented in this data format.

    channel: Pulse channel object.
    scaling: Vertical scaling factor of the channel.

- ComplexColors:
    Data set to represent a pair of color code associated with a real and
    an imaginary part of filled waveform colors.

    real: Color code for the real part of waveform.
    imaginary: Color code for the imaginary part of waveform.
