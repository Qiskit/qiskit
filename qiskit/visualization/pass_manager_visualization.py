    Draws the pass manager.

    This function needs `pydot <https://github.com/erocarrera/pydot>`, which in turn needs
    Graphviz <https://www.graphviz.org/>` to be installed.

    Args:
        pass_manager (PassManager): the pass manager to be drawn
        filename (str): file path to save image to
        style (dict or OrderedDict): keys are the pass classes and the values are
            the colors to make them. An example can be seen in the DEFAULT_STYLE. An ordered
            dict can be used to ensure a priority coloring when pass falls into multiple
            categories. Any values not included in the provided dict will be filled in from
            the default dict
        raw (Bool) : True if you want to save the raw Dot output not an image. The
            default is False.
    Returns:
        PIL.Image or None: an in-memory representation of the pass manager. Or None if
        no image was generated or PIL is not installed.
    Raises:
        ImportError: when nxpd or pydot not installed.
        VisualizationError: If raw=True and filename=None.
