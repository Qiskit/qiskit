    Each :class:`.PubResult` is a single element of a greater :class:`.PrimitiveResult`.  Within
    this result, there is implementation-defined freeform :attr:`metadata`, and a :class:`.DataBin`
    in the :attr:`data` field.

    Most likely, you care about accessing the processed data of your execution.  This is in the
    :attr:`data` attribute.  The :attr:`metadata` object may contain extra information about the
    execution of this pub, including implementation-specific information, which should be documented
    by your primitive provider (as opposed to :attr:`.PrimitiveResult.metadata`, which is metadata
    about the entire submission).

    You typically get instances of this class by iterating over or indexing into a
    :class:`.PrimitiveResult`, which is what you get from ``MyPritimive().run().result()``.
