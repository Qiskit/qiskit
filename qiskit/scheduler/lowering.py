    Return a list of Schedules and the qubits they operate on, for each element encountered in the
    input circuit.

    Without concern for the final schedule, extract and return a list of Schedules and the qubits
    they operate on, for each element encountered in the input circuit. Measures are grouped when
    possible, so ``qc.measure(q0, c0)`` or ``qc.measure(q1, c1)`` will generate a synchronous
    measurement pulse.

    Args:
        circuit: The quantum circuit to translate.
        schedule_config: Backend specific parameters used for building the Schedule.

    Returns:
        A list of CircuitPulseDefs: the pulse definition for each circuit element.

    Raises:
        QiskitError: If circuit uses a command that isn't defined in config.inst_map.
