    Return a schedule which measures the requested qubits according to the given
    instruction mapping and measure map, or by using the defaults provided by the backend.

    By default, the measurement results for each qubit are trivially mapped to the qubit
    index. This behavior is overridden by qubit_mem_slots. For instance, to measure
    qubit 0 into MemorySlot(1), qubit_mem_slots can be provided as {0: 1}.

        backend (BaseBackend): A backend instance, which contains hardware-specific data
            required for scheduling.
        inst_map: Mapping of circuit operations to pulse schedules. If None, defaults to the
                  ``instruction_schedule_map`` of ``backend``.
        meas_map: List of sets of qubits that must be measured together. If None, defaults to
                  the ``meas_map`` of ``backend``.
        qubit_mem_slots: Mapping of measured qubit index to classical bit index.
