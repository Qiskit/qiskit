"""Helper module for simplified Qiskit usage.

The functions in this module provide convenience helpers for accessing commonly
used features of the SDK in a simplified way. They support a small subset of
scenarios and flows: for more advanced usage, it is encouraged to instead
refer to the documentation of each component and use them separately.
