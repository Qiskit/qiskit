Synthesis of an n-qubit circuit containing only CZ gates for
linear nearest neighbor (LNN) connectivity, using CX and phase (S, Sdg or Z) gates.
The two-qubit depth of the circuit is bounded by 2*n+2.
This algorithm reverts the order of qubits.

def synth_cz_depth_line_mr(mat: np.ndarray) -> QuantumCircuit:
    r"""Synthesis of a CZ circuit for linear nearest neighbor (LNN) connectivity,
    based on Maslov and Roetteler.

    Note that this method *reverts* the order of qubits in the circuit,
    and returns a circuit containing :class:`.CXGate`\s and phase gates
    (:class:`.SGate`, :class:`.SdgGate` or :class:`.ZGate`).

    Args:
        mat: an upper-diagonal matrix representing the CZ circuit.
            ``mat[i][j]=1 for i<j`` represents a ``cz(i,j)`` gate

    Returns:
        A circuit implementation of the CZ circuit of depth :math:`2n+2` for LNN
        connectivity.
