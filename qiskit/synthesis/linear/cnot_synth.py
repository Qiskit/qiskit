    r"""
    Synthesize linear reversible circuits for all-to-all architecture
    using Patel, Markov and Hayes method.

    This function is an implementation of the Patel, Markov and Hayes algorithm from [1]
    for optimal synthesis of linear reversible circuits for all-to-all architecture,
    as specified by an :math:`n \times n` matrix.

    Args:
        state: :math:`n \times n` boolean invertible matrix, describing
            the state of the input circuit.
        section_size: The size of each section in the Patel–Markov–Hayes algorithm [1].
            If ``None`` it is chosen to be :math:`\max(2, \alpha\log_2(n))` with
            :math:`\alpha = 0.56`, which approximately minimizes the upper bound on the number
            of row operations given in [1] Eq. (3).

    Returns:
        A CX-only circuit implementing the linear transformation.

    Raises:
        ValueError: When ``section_size`` is larger than the number of columns.
