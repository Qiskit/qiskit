    """Construct a circuit for the Quantum Fourier Transform using all-to-all connectivity.

    .. note::

        With the default value of ``do_swaps = True``, this synthesis algorithm creates a
        circuit that faithfully implements the QFT operation. This circuit contains a sequence
        of swap gates at the end, corresponding to reversing the order of its output qubits.
        In some applications this reversal permutation can be avoided. Setting ``do_swaps = False``
        creates a circuit without this reversal permutation, at the expense that this circuit
        implements the "QFT-with-reversal" instead of QFT. Alternatively, the
        :class:`~.ElidePermutations` transpiler pass is able to remove these swap gates.

    Args:
        num_qubits: The number of qubits on which the Quantum Fourier Transform acts.
        do_swaps: Whether to synthesize the "QFT" or the "QFT-with-reversal" operation.
        approximation_degree: The degree of approximation (0 for no approximation).
            It is possible to implement the QFT approximately by ignoring
            controlled-phase rotations with the angle beneath a threshold. This is discussed
            in more detail in https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9601018 or
            https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0403071.
        insert_barriers: If ``True``, barriers are inserted for improved visualization.
        inverse: If ``True``, the inverse Quantum Fourier Transform is constructed.
        name: The name of the circuit.

    Returns:
        A circuit implementing the QFT operation.
