    """Construct a circuit for the Quantum Fourier Transform using linear
    neighbor connectivity.

    The construction is based on Fig 2.b in Fowler et al. [1].

    .. note::

        With the default value of ``do_swaps = True``, this synthesis algorithm creates a
        circuit that faithfully implements the QFT operation. When ``do_swaps = False``,
        this synthesis algorithm creates a circuit that corresponds to "QFT-with-reversal":
        applying the QFT and reversing the order of its output qubits.

    Args:
        num_qubits: The number of qubits on which the Quantum Fourier Transform acts.
        approximation_degree: The degree of approximation (0 for no approximation).
            It is possible to implement the QFT approximately by ignoring
            controlled-phase rotations with the angle beneath a threshold. This is discussed
            in more detail in https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9601018 or
            https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0403071.
        do_swaps: Whether to synthesize the "QFT" or the "QFT-with-reversal" operation.

    Returns:
        A circuit implementing the QFT operation.
