    """Synthesis of a QFT circuit for a linear nearest neighbor connectivity.
    Based on Fig 2.b in Fowler et al. [1].

    Note that this method *reverts* the order of qubits in the circuit,
    compared to the original :class:`.QFT` code.
    Hence, the default value of the ``do_swaps`` parameter is ``True``
    since it produces a circuit with fewer CX gates.

    Args:
        num_qubits: The number of qubits on which the QFT acts.
        approximation_degree: The degree of approximation (0 for no approximation).
        do_swaps: Whether to include the final swaps in the QFT.

    Return:
        A circuit implementation of the QFT circuit.
