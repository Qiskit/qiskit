def multiplier_cumulative_h18(
    num_state_qubits: int, num_result_qubits: int | None = None
) -> QuantumCircuit:
    r"""A multiplication circuit to store product of two input registers out-of-place.

    The circuit uses the approach from Ref. [1]. As an example, a multiplier circuit that
    performs a non-modular multiplication on two 3-qubit sized registers is:

    .. plot::
        :include-source:

        from qiskit.synthesis.arithmetic import multiplier_cumulative_h18

        num_state_qubits = 3
        circuit = multiplier_cumulative_h18(num_state_qubits)
        circuit.draw("mpl")

    Multiplication in this circuit is implemented in a classical approach by performing
    a series of shifted additions using one of the input registers while the qubits
    from the other input register act as control qubits for the adders.

    Args:
        num_state_qubits: The number of qubits in either input register for
            state :math:`|a\rangle` or :math:`|b\rangle`. The two input
            registers must have the same number of qubits.
        num_result_qubits: The number of result qubits to limit the output to.
            If number of result qubits is :math:`n`, multiplication modulo :math:`2^n` is performed
            to limit the output to the specified number of qubits. Default
            value is ``2 * num_state_qubits`` to represent any possible
            result from the multiplication of the two inputs.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If ``num_result_qubits`` is given and not valid, meaning not
            in ``[num_state_qubits, 2 * num_state_qubits]``.
