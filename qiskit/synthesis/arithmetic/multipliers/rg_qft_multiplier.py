def multiplier_qft_r17(

) -> QuantumCircuit:
    r"""A QFT multiplication circuit to store product of two input registers out-of-place.

    Multiplication in this circuit is implemented using the procedure of Fig. 3 in [1], where
    weighted sum rotations are implemented as given in Fig. 5 in [1]. QFT is used on the output
    register and is followed by rotations controlled by input registers. The rotations
    transform the state into the product of two input registers in QFT base, which is
    reverted from QFT base using inverse QFT.
    For example, on 3 state qubits, a full multiplier is given by:

    .. plot::
        :include-source:

        from qiskit.synthesis.arithmetic import multiplier_qft_r17

        num_state_qubits = 3
        circuit = multiplier_qft_r17(num_state_qubits)
        circuit.draw("mpl")

    Args:
        num_state_qubits: The number of qubits in either input register for
            state :math:`|a\rangle` or :math:`|b\rangle`. The two input
            registers must have the same number of qubits.
        num_result_qubits: The number of result qubits to limit the output to.
            If number of result qubits is :math:`n`, multiplication modulo :math:`2^n` is performed
            to limit the output to the specified number of qubits. Default
            value is ``2 * num_state_qubits`` to represent any possible
            result from the multiplication of the two inputs.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If ``num_result_qubits`` is given and not valid, meaning not
            in ``[num_state_qubits, 2 * num_state_qubits]``.
