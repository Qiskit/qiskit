    More precisely, if the input permutation is a cycle of length ``m``,
    then this creates a quantum circuit with ``m-1`` SWAPs (and of depth ``m-1``);
    if the input  permutation consists of several disjoint cycles, then each cycle
    is essentially treated independently.

        pattern: Permutation pattern, describing
            which qubits occupy the positions 0, 1, 2, etc. after applying the
            permutation. That is, ``pattern[k] = m`` when the permutation maps
            qubit ``m`` to position ``k``. As an example, the pattern ``[2, 4, 3, 0, 1]``
            means that qubit ``2`` goes to position ``0``, qubit ``4`` goes to
