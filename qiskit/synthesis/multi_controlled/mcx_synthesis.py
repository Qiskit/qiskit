    r"""
    Synthesize a multi-controlled X gate with :math:`k` controls based on the paper
    by Iten et al. [1].

    For :math:`k\ge 4`, the method uses :math:`k - 2` dirty ancillary qubits, producing a circuit
    with :math:`2 * k - 1` qubits and at most :math:`8 * k - 6` CX gates. For :math:`k\le 3`,
    explicitly constructed efficient circuits that require no ancillary qubits are used instead.

    Args:
        num_ctrl_qubits: The number of control qubits.

        relative_phase: when set to ``True``, the method applies the optimized multi-controlled X gate
            up to a relative phase, in a way that, by lemma 8 of [1], the relative
            phases of the ``action part`` cancel out with the phases of the ``reset part``.

        action_only: when set to ``True``, the method applies only the ``action part`` of lemma 8 of [1].

    Returns:
        The synthesized quantum circuit.

    Raises:
        QiskitError: if ``num_ctrl_qubits`` is illegal.
