    """
    Calls Rustiq's Pauli network synthesis algorithm.

    The algorithm is described in [1]. The source code (in Rust) is available at
    https://github.com/smartiel/rustiq-core.

    Args:
        num_qubits: the number of qubits over which the Pauli network is defined.
        pauli_network: a list of Pauli rotations, represented in sparse format: a list of
            triples such as `[("XX", [0, 3], theta), ("ZZ", [0, 1], 0.1)]`.
        optimize_count: if `True` the synthesis algorithm will try to optimize the 2-qubit
            gate count; and if `False` then the 2-qubit depth.
        preserve_order: whether the order of Paulis should be preserved, up to
            commutativity. If the order is not preserved, the returned circuit will
            generally not be equivalent to the given Pauli network.
        upto_clifford: if `True`, the final Clifford operator is not synthesized
            and the returned circuit will generally not be equivalent to the given
            Pauli network. In addition, the argument `upto_phase` would be ignored.
        upto_phase: if `True`, the global phase of the returned circuit may differ
             from the global phase of the given Pauli network. The argument is ignored
             when `upto_clifford` is `True`.
        resynth_clifford_method: describes the strategy to synthesize the final Clifford
            operator. If `0` a naive approach is used, which doubles the number of gates
            but preserves the global phase of the circuit. If `1`, the Clifford is
            resynthesized using Qiskit's greedy Clifford synthesis algorithm. If `2`, it
            is resynthesized by Rustiq itself. If `upto_phase` is `False`, the naive
            approach is used, as neither synthesis method preserves the global phase.

    If `preserve_order` is `true` and both `upto_clifford` and `upto_phase` are `false`,
    the returned circuit is equivalent to the given pauli network.

    Returns:
        A circuit implementation of the Pauli network.
