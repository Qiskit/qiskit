        Args:
            reps: The number of times to repeat the Trotterization circuit.
            insert_barriers: Whether to insert barriers between the atomic evolutions.
            cx_structure: How to arrange the CX gates for the Pauli evolutions, can be
                ``"chain"``, where next neighbor connections are used, or ``"fountain"``, where all
                qubits are connected to one. This only takes effect when
                ``atomic_evolution is None``.
            atomic_evolution: A function to apply the evolution of a single :class:`.Pauli`, or
                :class:`.SparsePauliOp` of only commuting terms, to a circuit. The function takes in
                three arguments: the circuit to append the evolution to, the Pauli operator to
                evolve, and the evolution time. By default, a single Pauli evolution is decomposed
                into a chain of ``CX`` gates and a single ``RZ`` gate.
                Alternatively, the function can also take Pauli operator and evolution time as
                inputs and returns the circuit that will be appended to the overall circuit being
                built.
            seed: An optional seed for reproducibility of the random sampling process.
            wrap: Whether to wrap the atomic evolutions into custom gate objects. This only takes
                effect when ``atomic_evolution is None``.
            preserve_order: If ``False``, allows reordering the terms of the operator to
                potentially yield a shallower evolution circuit. Not relevant
                when synthesizing operator with a single term.
