class SuzukiTrotter(ProductFormula):
    r"""The (higher order) Suzuki-Trotter product formula.

    The Suzuki-Trotter formulas improve the error of the Lie-Trotter approximation.
    For example, the second order decomposition is

    .. math::

        e^{A + B} \approx e^{B/2} e^{A} e^{B/2}.

    Higher order decompositions are based on recursions, see Ref. [1] for more details.

    In this implementation, the operators are provided as sum terms of a Pauli operator.
    For example, in the second order Suzuki-Trotter decomposition we approximate

    .. math::

        e^{-it(XI + ZZ)} = e^{-it/2 XI}e^{-it ZZ}e^{-it/2 XI} + \mathcal{O}(t^3).

            cx_structure: How to arrange the CX gates for the Pauli evolutions, can be ``"chain"``,
                where next neighbor connections are used, or ``"fountain"``, where all qubits are
                connected to one. This only takes effect when ``atomic_evolution is None``.
            atomic_evolution: A function to apply the evolution of a single :class:`.Pauli`, or
                :class:`.SparsePauliOp` of only commuting terms, to a circuit. The function takes in
                three arguments: the circuit to append the evolution to, the Pauli operator to
                evolve, and the evolution time. By default, a single Pauli evolution is decomposed
                into a chain of ``CX`` gates and a single ``RZ`` gate.
                Alternatively, the function can also take Pauli operator and evolution time as
                inputs and returns the circuit that will be appended to the overall circuit being
                built.
            wrap: Whether to wrap the atomic evolutions into custom gate objects. This only takes
                effect when ``atomic_evolution is None``.
            preserve_order: If ``False``, allows reordering the terms of the operator to
                potentially yield a shallower evolution circuit. Not relevant
                when synthesizing operator with a single term.
