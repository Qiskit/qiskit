def synth_clifford_greedy(clifford: Clifford) -> QuantumCircuit:
    """Decompose a :class:`.Clifford` operator into a :class:`.QuantumCircuit` based
    on the greedy Clifford compiler that is described in Appendix A of
    Bravyi, Hu, Maslov and Shaydulin [1].

    This method typically yields better CX cost compared to the Aaronson-Gottesman method.

    Note that this function only implements the greedy Clifford compiler from Appendix A
    of [1], and not the templates and symbolic Pauli gates optimizations
    that are mentioned in the same paper.

    Args:
        clifford: A Clifford operator.

    Returns:
        A circuit implementation of the Clifford.

    Raises:
        QiskitError: if symplectic Gaussian elimination fails.
