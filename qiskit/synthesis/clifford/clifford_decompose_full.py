    """Decompose a Clifford operator into a QuantumCircuit.

    For N <= 3 qubits this is based on optimal CX cost decomposition
    from reference [1]. For N > 3 qubits this is done using the general
    non-optimal greedy compilation routine from reference [3],
    which typically yields better CX cost compared to the AG method in [2].

    Args:
        clifford (Clifford): a clifford operator.
        method (str):  Optional, a synthesis method ('AG' or 'greedy').
             If set this overrides optimal decomposition for N <=3 qubits.

    Return:
        QuantumCircuit: a circuit implementation of the Clifford.
