class BackendV1(Backend, ABC):
    """Abstract class for Backends

    This abstract class is to be used for all Backend objects created by a
    provider. There are several classes of information contained in a Backend.
    The first are the attributes of the class itself. These should be used to
    defined the immutable characteristics of the backend. The ``options``
    attribute of the backend is used to contain the dynamic user configurable
    options of the backend. It should be used more for runtime options
    that configure how the backend is used. For example, something like a
    ``shots`` field for a backend that runs experiments which would contain an
    int for how many shots to execute. The ``properties`` attribute is
    optionally defined :class:`~qiskit.providers.models.BackendProperties`
    object and is used to return measured properties, or properties
    of a backend that may change over time. The simplest example of this would
    be a version string, which will change as a backend is updated, but also
    could be something like noise parameters for backends that run experiments.

    This first version of the Backend abstract class is written to be mostly
    backwards compatible with the legacy providers interface. This includes reusing
    the model objects :class:`~qiskit.providers.models.BackendProperties` and
    :class:`~qiskit.providers.models.BackendConfiguration`. This was done to
    ease the transition for users and provider maintainers to the new versioned providers.
    Expect, future versions of this abstract class to change the data model and
    interface.

class BackendV2(Backend, ABC):
    """Abstract class for Backends

    This abstract class is to be used for all Backend objects created by a
    provider. This version differs from earlier abstract Backend classes in
    that the configuration attribute no longer exists. Instead, attributes
    exposing equivalent required immutable properties of the backend device
    are added. For example ``backend.configuration().n_qubits`` is accessible
    from ``backend.num_qubits`` now.

    The ``options`` attribute of the backend is used to contain the dynamic
    user configurable options of the backend. It should be used more for
    runtime options that configure how the backend is used. For example,
    something like a ``shots`` field for a backend that runs experiments which
    would contain an int for how many shots to execute.

    If migrating a provider from :class:`~qiskit.providers.BackendV1` or
    :class:`~qiskit.providers.BaseBackend` one thing to keep in mind is for
    backwards compatibility you might need to add a configuration method that
    will build a :class:`~qiskit.providers.models.BackendConfiguration` object
    and :class:`~qiskit.providers.models.BackendProperties` from the attributes
    defined in this class for backwards compatibility.

    A backend object can optionally contain methods named
    ``get_translation_stage_plugin`` and ``get_scheduling_stage_plugin``. If these
    methods are present on a backend object and this object is used for
    :func:`~.transpile` or :func:`~.generate_preset_pass_manager` the
    transpilation process will default to using the output from those methods
    as the scheduling stage and the translation compilation stage. This
    enables a backend which has custom requirements for compilation to specify a
    stage plugin for these stages to enable custom transformation of
    the circuit to ensure it is runnable on the backend. These hooks are enabled
    by default and should only be used to enable extra compilation steps
    if they are **required** to ensure a circuit is executable on the backend or
    have the expected level of performance. These methods are passed no input
    arguments and are expected to return a ``str`` representing the method name
    which should be a stage plugin (see: :mod:`qiskit.transpiler.preset_passmanagers.plugin`
    for more details on plugins). The typical expected use case is for a backend
    provider to implement a stage plugin for ``translation`` or ``scheduling``
    that contains the custom compilation passes and then for the hook methods on
    the backend object to return the plugin name so that :func:`~.transpile` will
    use it by default when targetting the backend.
