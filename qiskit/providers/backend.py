class BackendV1(Backend, ABC):
    """Abstract class for Backends

    This abstract class is to be used for all Backend objects created by a
    provider. There are several classes of information contained in a Backend.
    The first are the attributes of the class itself. These should be used to
    defined the immutable characteristics of the backend. The ``options``
    attribute of the backend is used to contain the dynamic user configurable
    options of the backend. It should be used more for runtime options
    that configure how the backend is used. For example, something like a
    ``shots`` field for a backend that runs experiments which would contain an
    int for how many shots to execute. The ``properties`` attribute is
    optionally defined :class:`~qiskit.providers.models.BackendProperties`
    object and is used to return measured properties, or properties
    of a backend that may change over time. The simplest example of this would
    be a version string, which will change as a backend is updated, but also
    could be something like noise parameters for backends that run experiments.

    This first version of the Backend abstract class is written to be mostly
    backwards compatible with the legacy providers interface. This includes reusing
    the model objects :class:`~qiskit.providers.models.BackendProperties` and
    :class:`~qiskit.providers.models.BackendConfiguration`. This was done to
    ease the transition for users and provider maintainers to the new versioned providers.
    Expect, future versions of this abstract class to change the data model and
    interface.
