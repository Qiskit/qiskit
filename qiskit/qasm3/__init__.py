OpenQASM 3 (:mod:`qiskit.qasm3`)
================================

.. currentmodule:: qiskit.qasm3

Qiskit provides some tools for converting between `OpenQASM 3 <https://openqasm.com>`__
representations of quantum programs, and the :class:`.QuantumCircuit` class.  These will continue to
evolve as Qiskit's support for the dynamic-circuit capabilities expressed by OpenQASM 3 increases.


Exporting to OpenQASM 3
=======================

The high-level functions are simply :func:`dump` and :func:`dumps`, which respectively export to a
file (given as a filename) and to a Python string.

.. autofunction:: dump
.. autofunction:: dumps

Both of these exporter functions are single-use wrappers around the main :class:`Exporter` class.
For more complex exporting needs, including dumping multiple circuits in a single session, it may be
more convenient or faster to use the complete interface.

.. autoclass:: Exporter
    :members:

All of these interfaces will raise :exc:`QASM3ExporterError` on failure.

.. autoexception:: QASM3ExporterError


Importing from OpenQASM 3
=========================

Currently only two high-level functions are offered, as Qiskit support for importing from OpenQASM 3
is in its infancy, and the implementation is expected to change significantly.  The two functions
are :func:`load` and :func:`loads`, which are direct counterparts of :func:`dump` and :func:`dumps`,
respectively loading a program indirectly from a named file and directly from a given string.

.. note::

    While we are still in the exploratory release period, to use either function, the package
    ``qiskit_qasm3_import`` must be installed.  This can be done by installing Qiskit Terra with the
    ``qasm3-import`` extra, such as by:

    .. code-block:: text

        pip install qiskit-terra[qasm3-import]

    We expect that this functionality will eventually be merged into core Terra, and no longer
    require an optional import, but we do not yet have a timeline for this.

.. autofunction:: load
.. autofunction:: loads

Both of these two functions raise :exc:`QASM3ImporterError` on failure.

.. autoexception:: QASM3ImporterError

For example, we can define a quantum program using OpenQASM 3, and use :func:`loads` to directly
convert it into a :class:`.QuantumCircuit`:

.. plot::
    :include-source:

    import qiskit.qasm3

    program = \"\"\"
        OPENQASM 3.0;
        include "stdgates.inc";

        input float[64] a;
        qubit[3] q;
        bit[2] mid;
        bit[3] out;

        let aliased = q[0:1];

        gate my_gate(a) c, t {
          gphase(a / 2);
          ry(a) c;
          cx c, t;
        }
        gate my_phase(a) c {
          ctrl @ inv @ gphase(a) c;
        }

        my_gate(a * 2) aliased[0], q[{1, 2}][0];
        measure q[0] -> mid[0];
        measure q[1] -> mid[1];

        while (mid == "00") {
          reset q[0];
          reset q[1];
          my_gate(a) q[0], q[1];
          my_phase(a - pi/2) q[1];
          mid[0] = measure q[0];
          mid[1] = measure q[1];
        }

        if (mid[0]) {
          let inner_alias = q[{0, 1}];
          reset inner_alias;
        }

        out = measure q;
    \"\"\"
