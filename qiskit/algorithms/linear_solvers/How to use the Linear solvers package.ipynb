    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Refactor the `linear_solvers` module, so that the quantum algorithm (HHL) accepts oracles for the different blocks and computes different parameters according to the error bounds calculated in [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "### Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "An instance of the algorithm can be created by specifying the error tolerance, the problem to be solved is only specified when the `solve()` method is called:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from qiskit.aqua.algorithms.linear_solvers.hhl import HHL\n",
    "\n",
    "# initialise the algorithm. HHL() defaults to epsilon=1e-2\n",
    "hhl = HHL(epsilon=1e-3, further_params=...)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, it is possible to specify the different parameters of HHL (i.e. the number of qubits to represent the eigenvalues, the evolution time, ...) through setter methods. However it should be noted that in this case the error tolerance won't be guaranteed anymore. The reason for this is because from the theory in [1] we can calculate the different parameters to achieve an overall accuracy `epsilon`, but once one of these parameters is changed by the user, `epsilon` will change as well and is difficult to compute, so should be set to `None` (should this give a warning?).\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "hhl.n_l = 5 # number of qubits to represent the eigenvalues. Set epsilon=None and possibly raises a warning.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `solve()` method accepts up to five arguments: \n",
    "```python\n",
    "def solve(self, matrix: Union[np.ndarray, QuantumCircuit],\n",
    "          vector: Union[np.ndarray, QuantumCircuit],\n",
    "          observable: Optional[Union[LinearSystemObservable, BaseOperator,\n",
    "                                     List[BaseOperator]]] = None,\n",
    "          post_rotation: Optional[Union[QuantumCircuit, List[QuantumCircuit]]] = None,\n",
    "          post_processing: Optional[Callable[[Union[float, List[float]]],\n",
    "                                             Union[float, List[float]]]] = None) \\\n",
    "        -> LinearSolverResult:\n",
    "```\n",
    "The first two are the matrix defining the linear system and the vector right hand side of the equation (i.e. writing $Ax=b$, respectively $A$ and $b$). The remaining parameters concern the (list of) observable(s) to be computed out of the solution vector $x$, and can be specified in two different ways. One option is to give as the third and last parameter a (list of) `LinearSystemObservable`(s). Alternatively, we can give our own implementations of the `observable`, `post_rotation` and `post_processing`, where\n",
    "- `observable` is the operator to compute the expected value of the observable and can be e.g. a `PauliSumOp`\n",
    "- `post_rotation` is the circuit to be applied to the solution to extract information if additional gates are needed.\n",
    "- `post_processing` is the function to compute the value of the observable from the calculated probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Observables are required because the output of the quantum algorithm is a quantum state representing the vector $x$, however to learn all the components of this vector would take a linear time in its dimension diminishing any speedup obtained by the quantum algorithm. Thus, we can only compute functions from $x$ (the so called observables) to learn information about the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Input matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to specify $A$:\n",
    "- Most intuitive, although only useful for illustration, it can be specified as a numpy array:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "matrix = [[1/2, -2], [-2, 1/2]]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- If we know how to implement $e^{iAt}$, we can also give this circuit as an input. The circuit needs to be able to accept $t$ as a parameter, since this parameter will be specified within HHL and will change during the run of the algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from qiskit.circuit.library.blueprintcircuit import BlueprintCircuit\n",
    "class EvolutionCircuit(BlueprintCircuit):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, num_state_qubits, name='mcirc'):\n",
    "        super().__init__(name=name)\n",
    "        self.num_state_qubits = num_state_qubits\n",
    "        \n",
    "    # ...\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def _build(self, evolution_time=1):  # should we introduce an interface for such circuits?\n",
    "        # build code\n",
    "        \n",
    "matrix = EvolutionCircuit(1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- The matrix can be given as an operator (which can be evolved):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "matrix = (-1.05 * I) + (0.39 * Z) + (0.18 *  X) \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- The matrix can be given by a `time_evolution` algorithm, which needs to be added late as it is not defined yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Input vector\n",
    "\n",
    "HHL also accepts different types for the vector. Again, it can be specified as a numpy array for illustration:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "vector = [1, 0]\n",
    "```\n",
    "or as a circuit\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from qiskit import QuantumCircuit\n",
    "\n",
    "vector = QuantumCircuit(1)\n",
    "vector.h(0)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Input observable\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several types of available observables which can be given as input:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from qiskit.aqua.algorithms.linear_solvers.observables import AbsoluteAverage, ExpectedValue, MatrixFunctional\n",
    "\n",
    "observables = [AbsoluteAverage(...), ExpectedValue(...)]\n",
    "hhl = HHL(...)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `MatrixFunctional` class takes the main and off diagonal values of a tridiagonal symmetric Toeplitz matrix for its constuctor method.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "observables.append(MatrixFunctional(1, 1/2))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once these inputs are specified, we can run the algorithm and obtain the calculated value for each observable:\n",
    "However some observables will depend on the dimension of the system, which ideally one only specifies once `hhl.solve` is called. Therefore, we could allow to add observables from this method as well:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# run the algorithm and add an observable which depends on the dimension \n",
    "result = hhl.solve(matrix=matrix, vector=vector, observable=observables)\n",
    "\n",
    "# array with the calculated values for each observable\n",
    "observable_values = result.observable\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Further, the linear solver result contains a `result.state` method which returns the quantum circuit that prepares the solution state:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "solution = result.state\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, some algorithms can calculate the Euclidean norm of the vector solution. This can be accessed via\n",
    "```python\n",
    "result.euclidean_norm\n",
    "```\n",
    "which returns either a `float` or `None`.\n",
    "\n",
    "--------------------  This is not supported yet -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Another option is to run the `LinearSystem` algorithm without specifying an observable and then use the circuit as the input for the observable class:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "hhl = HHL(epsilon=1e-3)\n",
    "circuit = hhl.construct_circuit(matrix, vector, uncompute=True)  # allows some options\n",
    "# or \n",
    "result = hhl.solve(matrix, vector)\n",
    "circuit = result.solution\n",
    "\n",
    "observable = AbsoluteAverage()\n",
    "\n",
    "result = observable.evaluate(circuit)  # can also evaluate arrays, statevectors.\n",
    "```\n",
    "---------------------- Until here--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "#### State and working qubits\n",
    "\n",
    "Many circuits require working qubits. To distinguish between working and state qubits we use the qiskit `ancilla`-qubit flag. All non-flagged qubits are considered as state qubits.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Repeat-until-success (RUS) circuits\n",
    "\n",
    "It is quite common, e.g., for state preparation, i.e., preparing the vector, that circuits have to be repeated until some success criteria is met.\n",
    "Since this concept is not explicitely supported by Qiskit yet, we consider each circuit with measurements as a RUS circuit and will assume it has been successful if all measurements return state $|1\\rangle$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question: how should we handle this in the statevector simulation?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Future work\n",
    "\n",
    "- Add the Richardson extrapolation logic.\n",
    "- Add a `StateObservable` which returns the full vector solution (e.g. tomography).\n",
