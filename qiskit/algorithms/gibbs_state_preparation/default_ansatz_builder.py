def build_ansatz(num_qubits: int, depth: int):
    """
    Builds a default ansatz for a VarQITE-based Gibbs state preparation which relies on EfficientSU2
    ansatz. Together with parameter values constructed by the method build_init_ansatz_params_vals,
    it results in num_qubits/2 maximally entangled states, as expected by the VarQITE-based Gibbs
    state preparation algorithm.
    Args:
        num_qubits: Number of qubits for an ansatz. Should be the double of the number of qubits of
                    a Hamiltonian that defines a desired Gibbs state.
        depth: Depth of an EfficientSU2 ansatz quantum circuit.
