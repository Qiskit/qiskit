class SPSA(Optimizer):
    """Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA) optimizer.

    SPSA [1] is an gradient descent method for optimizing systems with multiple unknown parameters.
    As an optimization method, it is appropriately suited to large-scale population models,
    adaptive modeling, and simulation optimization.

    .. seealso::

        Many examples are presented at the `SPSA Web site <http://www.jhuapl.edu/SPSA>`__.

    The main feature of SPSA is the stochastic gradient approximation, which requires only two
    measurements of the objective function, regardless of the dimension of the optimization
    problem.

    Additionally to standard, first-order SPSA, where only gradient information is used, this
    implementation also allows second-order SPSA (2-SPSA) [2]. In 2-SPSA we also estimate the
    Hessian of the loss with a stochastic approximation and multiply the gradient with the
    inverse Hessian to take local curvature into account and improve convergence.
    Notably this Hessian estimate requires only a constant number of function evaluations
    unlike an exact evaluation of the Hessian, which scales quadratically in the number of
    function evaluations.

    .. note::

        SPSA can be used in the presence of noise, and it is therefore indicated in situations
        involving measurement uncertainty on a quantum computation when finding a minimum.
        If you are executing a variational algorithm using a Quantum ASseMbly Language (QASM)
        simulator or a real device, SPSA would be the most recommended choice among the optimizers
        provided here.

    The optimization process can includes a calibration phase if neither the ``learning_rate`` nor
    ``perturbation`` is provided, which requires additional functional evaluations.
    (Note that either both or none must be set.) For further details on the automatic calibration,
    please refer to the supplementary information section IV. of [3].

    .. note::

        This component has some function that is normally random. If you want to reproduce behavior
        then you should set the random number generator seed in the algorithm_globals
        (``qiskit.utils.algorithm_globals.random_seed = seed``).


    Examples:

        This short example runs SPSA for the ground state calculation of the ``Z ^ Z``
        observable where the ansatz is a ``PauliTwoDesign`` circuit.

        .. code-block:: python

            import numpy as np
            from qiskit.algorithms.optimizers import SPSA
            from qiskit.circuit.library import PauliTwoDesign
            from qiskit.opflow import Z, StateFn

            ansatz = PauliTwoDesign(2, reps=1, seed=2)
            observable = Z ^ Z
            initial_point = np.random.random(ansatz.num_parameters)

            def loss(x):
                bound = ansatz.bind_parameters(x)
                return np.real((StateFn(observable, is_measurement=True) @ StateFn(bound)).eval())

            spsa = SPSA(maxiter=300)
            result = spsa.optimize(ansatz.num_parameters, loss, initial_point=initial_point)

        To use the Hessian information, i.e. 2-SPSA, you can add `second_order=True` to the
        initializer of the `SPSA` class, the rest of the code remains the same.

        .. code-block:: python

            two_spsa = SPSA(maxiter=300, second_order=True)
            result = two_spsa.optimize(ansatz.num_parameters, loss, initial_point=initial_point)

        The `termination_checker` can be used to implement a custom termination criterion.

        .. code-block:: python

            import numpy as np
            from qiskit.algorithms.optimizers import SPSA

            def objective(x):
                return np.linalg.norm(x) + .04*np.random.rand(1)

            class TerminationChecker:

                def __init__(self, N : int):
                    self.N = N
                    self.values = []

                def __call__(self, nfev, parameters, value, stepsize, accepted) -> bool:
                    self.values.append(value)

                    if len(self.values) > self.N:
                        last_values = self.values[-self.N:]
                        pp = np.polyfit(range(self.N), last_values, 1)
                        slope = pp[0] / self.N

                        if slope > 0:
                            return True
                    return False

            spsa = SPSA(maxiter=200, termination_checker=TerminationChecker(10))
            parameters, value, niter = spsa.optimize(2, objective, initial_point=[0.5, 0.5])

        r"""
        Args:
            maxiter: The maximum number of iterations. Note that this is not the maximal number
                of function evaluations.
            blocking: If True, only accepts updates that improve the loss (up to some allowed
                increase, see next argument).
            allowed_increase: If ``blocking`` is ``True``, this argument determines by how much
                the loss can increase with the proposed parameters and still be accepted.
                If ``None``, the allowed increases is calibrated automatically to be twice the
                approximated standard deviation of the loss function.
            trust_region: If ``True``, restricts the norm of the update step to be :math:`\leq 1`.
            learning_rate: The update step is the learning rate is multiplied with the gradient.
                If the learning rate is a float, it remains constant over the course of the
                optimization. If a NumPy array, the :math:`i`-th element is the learning rate for
                the :math:`i`-th iteration. It can also be a callable returning an iterator which
                yields the learning rates for each optimization step.
                If ``learning_rate`` is set ``perturbation`` must also be provided.
            perturbation: Specifies the magnitude of the perturbation for the finite difference
                approximation of the gradients. See ``learning_rate`` for the supported types.
                If ``perturbation`` is set ``learning_rate`` must also be provided.
            last_avg: Return the average of the ``last_avg`` parameters instead of just the
                last parameter values.
            resamplings: The number of times the gradient (and Hessian) is sampled using a random
                direction to construct a gradient estimate. Per default the gradient is estimated
                using only one random direction. If an integer, all iterations use the same number
                of resamplings. If a dictionary, this is interpreted as
                ``{iteration: number of resamplings per iteration}``.
            perturbation_dims: The number of perturbed dimensions. Per default, all dimensions
                are perturbed, but a smaller, fixed number can be perturbed. If set, the perturbed
                dimensions are chosen uniformly at random.
            second_order: If True, use 2-SPSA instead of SPSA. In 2-SPSA, the Hessian is estimated
                additionally to the gradient, and the gradient is preconditioned with the inverse
                of the Hessian to improve convergence.
            regularization: To ensure the preconditioner is symmetric and positive definite, the
                identity times a small coefficient is added to it. This generator yields that
                coefficient.
            hessian_delay: Start multiplying the gradient with the inverse Hessian only after a
                certain number of iterations. The Hessian is still evaluated and therefore this
                argument can be useful to first get a stable average over the last iterations before
                using it as preconditioner.
            lse_solver: The method to solve for the inverse of the Hessian. Per default an
                exact LSE solver is used, but can e.g. be overwritten by a minimization routine.
            initial_hessian: The initial guess for the Hessian. By default the identity matrix
                is used.
            callback: A callback function passed information in each iteration step. The
                information is, in this order: the number of function evaluations, the parameters,
                the function value, the stepsize, whether the step was accepted.
            termination_checker: A callback function executed at the end of each iteration step. The
                arguments are, in this order: the parameters, the function value, the number
                of function evaluations, the stepsize, whether the step was accepted. If the callback
                returns True, the optimization is terminated.
                To prevent additional evaluations of the objective method, if the objective has not yet
                been evaluated, the objective is estimated by taking the mean of the objective
                evaluations used in the estimate of the gradient.


        Raises:
            ValueError: If ``learning_rate`` or ``perturbation`` is an array with less elements
