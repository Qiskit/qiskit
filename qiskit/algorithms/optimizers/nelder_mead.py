    Nelder-Mead optimizer.

    The Nelder-Mead algorithm performs unconstrained optimization; it ignores bounds
    or constraints.  It is used to find the minimum or maximum of an objective function
    in a multidimensional space.  It is based on the Simplex algorithm. Nelder-Mead
    is robust in many applications, especially when the first and second derivatives of the
    objective function are not known.

    However, if the numerical computation of the derivatives can be trusted to be accurate,
    other algorithms using the first and/or second derivatives information might be preferred to
    Nelder-Mead for their better performance in the general case, especially in consideration of
    the fact that the Nelderâ€“Mead technique is a heuristic search method that can converge to
    non-stationary points.

    Uses scipy.optimize.minimize Nelder-Mead.
