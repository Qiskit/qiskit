Optimizers (:mod:`qiskit.algorithms.optimizers`)
=====================================================
It  contains a variety of classical optimizers for use by quantum variational algorithms,
such as :class:`~qiskit.algorithms.VQE`.
Logically, these optimizers can be divided into two categories:

`Local Optimizers`_
  Given an optimization problem, a **local optimizer** is a function
  that attempts to find an optimal value within the neighboring set of a candidate solution.

`Global Optimizers`_
  Given an optimization problem, a **global optimizer** is a function
  that attempts to find an optimal value among all possible solutions.

Optimizer Base Class
====================

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: ../stubs/
   :nosignatures:

   OptimizerResult
   OptimizerSupportLevel
   Optimizer

Local Optimizers
================

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: ../stubs/
   :nosignatures:

   ADAM
   AQGD
   CG
   COBYLA
   L_BFGS_B
   GSLS
   GradientDescent
   NELDER_MEAD
   NFT
   P_BFGS
   POWELL
   SLSQP
   SPSA
   QNSPSA
   TNC
   SciPyOptimizer

Qiskit also provides the following optimizers, which are built-out using the optimizers from
the `scikit-quant` package. The `scikit-quant` package is not installed by default but must be
explicitly installed, if desired, by the user - the optimizers therein are provided under various
licenses so it has been made an optional install for the end user to choose whether to do so or
not. To install the `scikit-quant` dependent package you can use
`pip install scikit-quant`.

   :toctree: ../stubs/
   :nosignatures:

   BOBYQA
   IMFIL
   SNOBFIT

Global Optimizers
=================
The global optimizers here all use NLopt for their core function and can only be
used if their dependent NLopt package is manually installed. See the following
section for installation instructions.

.. autosummary::
    :toctree: ../stubs/

    nlopts

The global optimizers are as follows:

   CRS
   DIRECT_L
   DIRECT_L_RAND
   ESCH
   ISRES
