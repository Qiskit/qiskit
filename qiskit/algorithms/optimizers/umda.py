class UMDA(SciPyOptimizer):
    """Continuous Univariate Marginal Distribution Algorithm (UMDA).

    UMDA [1] is a specific type of Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (EDA) where new individuals
    are sampled from univariate normal distributions and are updated in each iteration of the
    algorithm by the best individuals found in the previous iteration.

    .. seealso::

        This code and analysis where obtained from EDAspy Python package [2].

    EDAs are stochastic search algorithms and belongs to the family of the evolutionary algorithms.
    The main difference is that EDAs have a probabilistic model which is updated in each iteration
    from the best individuals of previous generations (elite selection). Depending on the complexity
    of the probabilistic model, EDAs can be classified in a different way. In this case, UMDA is a
    univariate EDA as the embedded probabilistic model is univariate.

    UMDA has been compared to some of the already implemented algorithms in Qiskit library to
    optimize the parameters of a Variational algorithm such as QAOA or VQE and competitive results
    have been obtained [1]. UMDA seems to provide very good solutions for those circuits in which
    the number of layers is not big.

    The optimization process can be personalized depending on the paremeters chosen in the
    initialization. The main parameter is the population size. As bigger it is, the performance
    will be better. However, this increases the complexity of the algorithm and the runtime will
    be much heavier. In the work [1] different experiments have been performed where population
    size has been set to 20 - 30.

    .. note::

        The UMDA implementation has more parameter but these have been set in the initialization
        for better understanding of the user. For example, ``\alpha`` parameter has been set to 0.5
        and is the percentage of the population which is selected in each iteration to update the
        probabilistic model.


    Example:

        This short example runs UMDA for a toy example of the MAX-CUT problem.

        .. code-block:: python

            import numpy as np
            import networkx as nx
            from qiskit_optimization.applications import Maxcut, Tsp

            # Generating a graph of 4 nodes

            n = 4  # Number of nodes in graph
            G = nx.Graph()
            G.add_nodes_from(np.arange(0, n, 1))
            elist = [(0, 1, 1.0), (0, 2, 1.0), (0, 3, 1.0), (1, 2, 1.0), (2, 3, 1.0)]
            # tuple is (i,j,weight) where (i,j) is the edge
            G.add_weighted_edges_from(elist)

            # Computing the weight matrix from the random graph
            w = np.zeros([n, n])
            for i in range(n):
                for j in range(n):
                    temp = G.get_edge_data(i, j, default=0)
                    if temp != 0:
                        w[i, j] = temp["weight"]
            print(w)

            max_cut = Maxcut(w)
            qp = max_cut.to_quadratic_program()
            print(qp.export_as_lp_string())
            qubitOp, offset = qp.to_ising()

            # Run the algorithm

            algorithm_globals.random_seed = 123
            seed = 10598
            backend = Aer.get_backend("aer_simulator_statevector")
            quantum_instance = QuantumInstance(backend, seed_simulator=seed, seed_transpiler=seed)

            p = 2  # Toy example: 2 layers with 2 parameters in each layer: 4 variables

            opt = UMDA(maxiter=100, size_gen=20, n_variables=p*2, disp=True)

            backend = Aer.get_backend('statevector_simulator')
            vqe = QAOA(opt,
                       quantum_instance=QuantumInstance(backend=backend),
                       reps=p)

            result = vqe.compute_minimum_eigenvalue(operator=qubit_op)

        If it is desired to modify the percentage of individuals considered to update the
        probabilistic model, then this code can be used. Here for example we set the 60% instead
        of the 50% predefined.

        .. code-block:: python

            opt = UMDA(maxiter=100, size_gen=20, n_variables=p*2, alpha = 0.6, disp=True)

            backend = Aer.get_backend('statevector_simulator')
            vqe = QAOA(opt,
                       quantum_instance=QuantumInstance(backend=backend),
                       reps=p)

            result = vqe.compute_minimum_eigenvalue(operator=qubit_op)
