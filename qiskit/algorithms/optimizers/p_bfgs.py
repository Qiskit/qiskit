    """
    Parallelized Limited-memory BFGS optimizer.

    P-BFGS is a parallelized version of :class:`L_BFGS_B` with which it shares the same parameters.
    P-BFGS can be useful when the target hardware is a quantum simulator running on a classical
    machine. This allows the multiple processes to use simulation to potentially reach a minimum
    faster. The parallelization may also help the optimizer avoid getting stuck at local optima.

    Uses scipy.optimize.fmin_l_bfgs_b.
