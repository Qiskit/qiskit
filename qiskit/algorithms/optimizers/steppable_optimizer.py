class SteppableOptimizer(Optimizer):
    """
    Base class for a steppable optimizer.

    This family of optimizers uses the `ask and tell interface
    <https://optuna.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/20_recipes/009_ask_and_tell.html>`_.
    When using this interface the user has to call :meth:`~.ask` to get information about
    how to evaluate the fucntion (we are asking the optimizer about how to do the evaluation).
    This information is typically the next points at which the function is evaluated, but depending
    on the optimizer it can also determine whether to evaluate the function or its gradient.
    Once the function has been evaluated, the user calls the method :meth:`~..tell`
    to tell the optimizer what the result of the function evaluation(s) is. The optimizer then
    updates its state accordingly and the user can decide whether to stop the optimization process
    or to repeat a step.

    This interface is more customizable, and allows the user to have full control over the evaluation
    of the function.

    Examples:

        An example where the evaluation of the function has a chance of failing. The user, with
        specific knowledge about his function can catch this errors and handle them before passing
        the result to the optimizer.

    Users that aren't dealing with complicated functions and who are more familiar with step by step
    optimization algorithms can use the :meth:`~.step` method which wraps the :meth:`~.ask`
    and :meth:`~.tell` methods. In the same spirit the method :meth:`~.minimize` will optimize the
    function and return the result.
