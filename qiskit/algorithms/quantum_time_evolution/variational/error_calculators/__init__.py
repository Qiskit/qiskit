Error Calculators (:mod:`qiskit.algorithms.quantum_time_evolution.variational.error_calculators`)
=====================================================
The error calculators include helper functions to evaluate errors that occur during the
variational quantum time evolution, such as the error in the state gradient at time `t` which is
due to the variational approximation.


# TODO @Dal list functions
