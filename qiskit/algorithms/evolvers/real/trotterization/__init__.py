"""This package contains Trotterization-based Quantum Real Time Evolution algorithm.
It is compliant with the new Quantum Time Evolution Framework and makes use ProductFormula and
PauliEvolutionGate implementations.
The evolution with gradients assumes that a Hamiltonian is a linear combination of PauliOp objects
w.r.t. given parameters. It case of a single summand, it might be a PauliOp, or an OperatorBase.
Gradients are taken w.r.t. to a time parameter using the finite difference method (if
a Hamiltonian is time-dependent via t_param = Parameter("t")) and/or w.r.t. parameters present in a
Hamiltonian using an expectation value through a custom observable."""
