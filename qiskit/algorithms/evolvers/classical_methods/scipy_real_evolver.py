class SciPyRealEvolver(RealEvolver, SciPyEvolver):
    r"""Classical Evolver for real time evolution.

    Evolves an initial state :math:`|\Psi\rangle` for a time :math:`t`
    under a Hamiltonian  :math:`H`, as provided in the ``evolution_problem``.

    In order to perform one timestep :math:`\delta t` of the evolution, we need to implement:

    .. math::

        |\Psi ( t + \delta t ) \rangle = \exp(-i \delta t H) |\Psi (t ) \rangle

    Which can be approximated as:

    .. math::

        \exp(-i \delta t H) = \left(1+ i \frac{\delta t}{2} H \right) ^{-1}
                                \left( 1 - i \frac{\delta t}{2} H \right)
                                + O\left( \delta t^3 \right)

    Note that this operator is unitary, and thus we won't need to renormalize the state at
    each step. In order to find :math:`|\Psi ( t + \delta t ) \rangle` we then
    need to solve a linear system of equations:

    .. math::

        \left( 1+ i \frac{\delta t}{2} H \right) |\Psi ( t + \delta t ) \rangle
                = \left( 1 - i \frac{\delta t}{2} H \right) |\Psi( t ) \rangle
