        Calculates an evolution gradient according to the rules of this variational principle.

        Args:
            hamiltonian: Operator used for Variational Quantum Time Evolution. The operator may be
                given either as a composed op consisting of a Hermitian observable and a
                ``CircuitStateFn`` or a ``ListOp`` of a ``CircuitStateFn`` with a ``ComboFn``. The
                latter case enables the evaluation of a Quantum Natural Gradient.
            ansatz: Quantum state in the form of a parametrized quantum circuit.
            circuit_sampler: A circuit sampler.
            param_dict: Dictionary which relates parameter values to the parameters in the ansatz.
            bind_params: List of parameters that are supposed to be bound.
            gradient_params: List of parameters with respect to which gradients should be computed.
            param_values: Values of parameters to be bound.
            expectation: An instance of ``ExpectationBase`` used for calculating an evolution
                gradient. If ``None`` provided, a ``PauliExpectation`` is used.
            quantum_instance: Backend used to evaluate the quantum circuit outputs. If ``None``
                provided, everything will be evaluated based on matrix multiplication (which is
                slow).

        Returns:
            An evolution gradient.
