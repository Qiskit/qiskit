    Introduced extensions to VQD algorithm in qiskit.algorithms.eigensolvers.
    It is now possible to have as input arguments in addition to a single
    initial point, a list of initial points for the optimization.
    Each k-th initial point is related to the k-th eigenstate.
    A similar modification is for the optimizers, i.e. give as input a single
    optimizer or a list of optimizers.
