class HamiltonianPhaseEstimation:
    r"""Run the Quantum Phase Estimation algorithm to find the eigenvalues of a Hermitian operator.

    This class is nearly the same as :class:`~qiskit.algorithms.PhaseEstimation`, differing only
    in that the input in that class is a unitary operator, whereas here the input is a Hermitian
    operator from which a unitary will be obtained by scaling and exponentiating. The scaling is
    performed in order to prevent the phases from wrapping around :math:`2\pi`.
    The problem of estimating eigenvalues :math:`\lambda_j` of the Hermitian operator
    :math:`H` is solved by running a circuit representing

    .. math::

        \exp(i b H) |\psi\rangle = \sum_j \exp(i b \lambda_j) c_j |\lambda_j\rangle,

    where the input state is

    .. math::

        |\psi\rangle = \sum_j c_j |\lambda_j\rangle,

    and :math:`\lambda_j` are the eigenvalues of :math:`H`.

    Here, :math:`b` is a scaling factor sufficiently large to map positive :math:`\lambda` to
    :math:`[0,\pi)` and negative :math:`\lambda` to :math:`[\pi,2\pi)`. Each time the circuit is
    run, one measures a phase corresponding to :math:`lambda_j` with probability :math:`|c_j|^2`.

    If :math:`H` is a Pauli sum, the bound :math:`b` is computed from the sum of the absolute
    values of the coefficients of the terms. There is no way to reliably recover eigenvalues
    from phases very near the endpoints of these intervals. Because of this you should be aware
    that for degenerate cases, such as :math:`H=Z`, the eigenvalues :math:`\pm 1` will be
    mapped to the same phase, :math:`\pi`, and so cannot be distinguished. In this case, you need
    to specify a larger bound as an argument to the method ``estimate``.

    This class uses and works together with :class:`~qiskit.algorithms.PhaseEstimationScale` to
    manage scaling the Hamiltonian and the phases that are obtained by the QPE algorithm. This
    includes setting, or computing, a bound on the eigenvalues of the operator, using this
    bound to obtain a scale factor, scaling the operator, and shifting and scaling the measured
    phases to recover the eigenvalues.

    Note that, although we speak of "evolving" the state according the the Hamiltonian, in the
    present algorithm, we are not actually considering time evolution. Rather, the role of time is
    played by the scaling factor, which is chosen to best extract the eigenvalues of the
    Hamiltonian.

    A few of the ideas in the algorithm may be found in Ref. [1].
