        Calculates an evolution gradient according to the rules of this variational principle.

                ``CircuitStateFn`` or a ``ListOp`` of a ``CircuitStateFn`` with a ``ComboFn``. The

            ansatz: Quantum state in the form of a parametrized quantum circuit.
            param_dict: Dictionary which relates parameter values to the parameters in the ansatz.
            bind_params: List of parameters that are supposed to be bound.
            gradient_params: List of parameters with respect to which gradients should be computed.
