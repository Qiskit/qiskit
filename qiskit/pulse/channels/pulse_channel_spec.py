class PulseChannelSpec:
    """A helper class to support assembling channel objects and their mapping to qubits.
    This class can be initialized with two methods shown as below.

    1. With the `BaseBackend` object of the target pulse backend:
        ```python
        system = PulseChannelSpec.from_backend(backend)
        ```

    2. By specifying the number of pulse elements constituting the target quantum computing system:
        ```python
        system = PulseChannelSpec(n_qubits=5, n_control=6, n_registers=1, buffer=10)
        ```

    Within Qiskit a quantum computing system at the level of pulses is abstracted as
    a combination of multiple types of channels on which instructions are scheduled.
    These most common channel types are the:
      - `PulseChannel`: For performing stimulus of the system.
      - `AcquireChannel`: For scheduling acquisition of qubit data.
      - `MemorySlot`: For persistent storage of measurement results.
      - `RegisterSlot`: For temporary storage of and conditional feedback on measurement results.

    There are also several special types of pulse channels which are the:
      - `DriveChannel`: Used to control a single qubit.
      - `MeasureChannel`: Used to perform measurement stimulus of a single qubit.
      - `ControlChannel`: Used to control an arbitrary Hamiltonian term on the system.
      Typically a two-qubit interaction.

    A collection of above channels is automatically assembled within `PulseChannelSpec`.

    For example, the zeroth drive channel may be accessed by
        ```python
        system.drives[0]
        ```
    or if the channel is connected to the first qubit,
        ```python
        system.qubits[0].drive
        ```
    In the above example, both commands refer to the same object.
