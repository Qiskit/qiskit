"""The ``instruction`` module holds the various ``Instruction`` s which are supported by
Qiskit Pulse. Instructions have operands, which typically include at least one
:py:class:`~qiskit.pulse.channels.Channel` specifying where the instruction will be applied.

Every instruction has a duration, whether explicitly included as an operand or implicitly defined.
For instance, a :py:class:`~qiskit.pulse.instructions.ShiftPhase` instruction can be instantiated
with operands *phase* and *channel*, for some float ``phase`` and a
:py:class:`~qiskit.pulse.channels.Channel` ``channel``::

    ShiftPhase(phase, channel)

The duration of this instruction is implicitly zero. On the other hand, the
:py:class:`~qiskit.pulse.instructions.Delay` instruction takes an explicit duration::

    Delay(duration, channel)

An instruction can be added to a :py:class:`~qiskit.pulse.Schedule`, which is a
sequence of scheduled Pulse ``Instruction`` s over many channels. ``Instruction`` s and
``Schedule`` s implement the same interface.
