    """Return new schedules where measurements occur at the same physical time.

    This transformation will align the first :class:`qiskit.pulse.Acquire` on
    every channel to occur at the same time.

    Minimum measurement wait time (to allow for calibration pulses) is enforced
    and may be set with ``max_calibration_duration``.

    By default only instructions containing a :class:`~qiskit.pulse.AcquireChannel`
    or :class:`~qiskit.pulse.MeasureChannel` will be shifted. If you wish to keep
    the relative timing of all instructions in the schedule set ``align_all=True``.

    This method assumes that ``MeasureChannel(i)`` and ``AcquireChannel(i)``
    correspond to the same qubit and the acquire/play instructions
    should be shifted together on these channels.
