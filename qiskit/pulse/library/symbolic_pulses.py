class SymbolicPulse(Pulse):
    r"""The pulse representation model with parameters and symbolic expressions.

    A symbolic pulse instance can be defined with an envelope and parameter constraints.
    Envelope and parameter constraints should be provided as symbolic expressions.
    Rather than creating a subclass, different pulse shapes can be distinguished by
    the instance attributes :attr:`SymbolicPulse.envelope` and :attr:`SymbolicPulse.pulse_type`.

    The symbolic expressions must be defined either with SymPy_ or Symengine_.
    Usually Symengine-based expression is much more performant for instantiation
    of the :class:`SymbolicPulse`, however, it doesn't support every functions available in SymPy.
    You may need to choose proper library depending on how you define your pulses.
    Symengine works in the most envelopes and constraints, and thus it is recommended to use
    this library especially when your program contains a lot of pulses.
    Also note that Symengine has the limited platform support and may not be available
    for your local system. Symengine is a required dependency for Qiskit on platforms
    that support it will always be installed along with Qiskit on macOS ``x86_64`` and ``arm64``,
    and Linux ``x86_64``, ``aarch64``, and ``ppc64le``.
    For 64-bit Windows users they will need to manual install it.
    For 32-bit platforms such as ``i686`` and ``armv7`` Linux, and on Linux ``s390x``
    there are no pre-compiled packages available and to use symengine you'll need to
    compile it from source. If Symengine is not available in your environment SymPy will be used.

    .. _symbolic_pulse_envelope:

    .. rubric:: Envelope function

    The waveform at time :math:`t` is generated by the :meth:`get_waveform` according to

    .. math::

        F(t, \Theta) = \times F(t, {\rm duration}, \overline{\rm params})

    where :math:`\Theta` is the set of full pulse parameters in the :attr:`SymbolicPulse.parameters`
    dictionary which must include the :math:`\rm duration`.
    Note that the :math:`F` is an envelope of the waveform, and a programmer must provide this
    as a symbolic expression. :math:`\overline{\rm params}` can be arbitrary complex values
    as long as they pass :meth:`.validate_parameters` and your quantum backend can accept.
    The time :math:`t` and :math:`\rm duration` are in units of dt, i.e. sample time resolution,
    and this function is sampled with a discrete time vector in :math:`[0, {\rm duration}]`
    sampling the pulse envelope at every 0.5 dt (middle sampling strategy) when
    the :meth:`SymbolicPulse.get_waveform` method is called.
    The sample data is not generated until this method is called
    thus a symbolic pulse instance only stores parameter values and waveform shape,
    which greatly reduces memory footprint during the program generation.


    .. _symbolic_pulse_validation:

    .. rubric:: Pulse validation

    When a symbolic pulse is instantiated, the method :meth:`.validate_parameters` is called,
    and performs validation of the pulse. The validation process involves testing the constraint
    functions and the maximal amplitude of the pulse (see below). While the validation process
    will improve code stability, it will reduce performance and might create
    compatibility issues (particularly with JAX). Therefore, it is possible to disable the
    validation by setting the class attribute :attr:`.disable_validation` to ``True``.

    .. _symbolic_pulse_constraints:

    .. rubric:: Constraint functions

    Constraints on the parameters are defined with an instance attribute
    :attr:`SymbolicPulse.constraints` which can be provided through the constructor.
    The constraints value must be a symbolic expression, which is a
    function of parameters to be validated and must return a boolean value
    being ``True`` when parameters are valid.
    If there are multiple conditions to be evaluated, these conditions can be
    concatenated with logical expressions such as ``And`` and ``Or`` in SymPy or Symengine.
    The symbolic pulse instance can be played only when the constraint function returns ``True``.
    The constraint is evaluated when :meth:`.validate_parameters` is called.


    .. _symbolic_pulse_eval_condition:

    .. rubric:: Maximum amplitude validation

    When you play a pulse in a quantum backend, you might face the restriction on the power
    that your waveform generator can handle. Usually, the pulse amplitude is normalized
    by this maximum power, namely :math:`\max |F| \leq 1`. This condition is
    evaluated along with above constraints when you set ``limit_amplitude = True`` in the constructor.
    To evaluate maximum amplitude of the waveform, we need to call :meth:`get_waveform`.
    However, this introduces a significant overhead in the validation, and this cannot be ignored
    when you repeatedly instantiate symbolic pulse instances.
    :attr:`SymbolicPulse.valid_amp_conditions` provides a condition to skip this waveform validation,
    and the waveform is not generated as long as this condition returns ``True``,
    so that `healthy` symbolic pulses are created very quick.
    For example, for a simple pulse shape like ``amp * cos(f * t)``, we know that
    pulse amplitude is valid as long as ``amp`` remains less than magnitude 1.0.
    So ``abs(amp) <= 1`` could be passed as :attr:`SymbolicPulse.valid_amp_conditions` to skip
    doing a full waveform evaluation for amplitude validation.
    This expression is provided through the constructor. If this is not provided,
    the waveform is generated everytime when :meth:`.validate_parameters` is called.


    .. rubric:: Examples

    This is how a user can instantiate a symbolic pulse instance.
    In this example, we instantiate a custom `Sawtooth` envelope.

    .. code-block::

        from qiskit.pulse.library import SymbolicPulse

        my_pulse = SymbolicPulse(
            pulse_type="Sawtooth",
            duration=100,
            parameters={"amp": 0.1, "freq": 0.05},
            name="pulse1",
        )

    Note that :class:`SymbolicPulse` can be instantiated without providing
    the envelope and constraints. However, this instance cannot generate waveforms
    without knowing the envelope definition. Now you need to provide the envelope.

    .. plot::
       :include-source:

        import sympy
        from qiskit.pulse.library import SymbolicPulse

        t, amp, freq = sympy.symbols("t, amp, freq")
        envelope = 2 * amp * (freq * t - sympy.floor(1 / 2 + freq * t))

        my_pulse = SymbolicPulse(
            pulse_type="Sawtooth",
            duration=100,
            parameters={"amp": 0.1, "freq": 0.05},
            envelope=envelope,
            name="pulse1",
        )

        my_pulse.draw()

    Likewise, you can define :attr:`SymbolicPulse.constraints` for ``my_pulse``.
    After providing the envelope definition, you can generate the waveform data.
    Note that it would be convenient to define a factory function that automatically
    accomplishes this procedure.

    .. code-block:: python

        def Sawtooth(duration, amp, freq, name):
            t, amp, freq = sympy.symbols("t, amp, freq")

            instance = SymbolicPulse(
                pulse_type="Sawtooth",
                duration=duration,
                parameters={"amp": amp, "freq": freq},
                envelope=2 * amp * (freq * t - sympy.floor(1 / 2 + freq * t)),
                name=name,
            )

            return instance

    You can also provide a :class:`Parameter` object in the ``parameters`` dictionary,
    or define ``duration`` with a :class:`Parameter` object when you instantiate
    the symbolic pulse instance.
    A waveform cannot be generated until you assign all unbounded parameters.
    Note that parameters will be assigned through the schedule playing the pulse.


    .. _symbolic_pulse_serialize:

    .. rubric:: Serialization

    The :class:`~SymbolicPulse` subclass can be serialized along with the
    symbolic expressions through :mod:`qiskit.qpy`.
    A user can therefore create a custom pulse subclass with a novel envelope and constraints,
    and then one can instantiate the class with certain parameters to run on a backend.
    This pulse instance can be saved in the QPY binary, which can be loaded afterwards
    even within the environment not having original class definition loaded.
    This mechanism also allows us to easily share a pulse program including
    custom pulse instructions with collaborators.

    """An echoed Gaussian square pulse with an active tone overlaid on it.

    The Gaussian Square Echo pulse is composed of three pulses. First, a Gaussian Square pulse
    :math:`f_{echo}(x)` with amplitude ``amp`` and phase ``angle`` playing for half duration,
    followed by a second Gaussian Square pulse :math:`-f_{echo}(x)` with opposite amplitude
    and same phase playing for the rest of the duration. Third a Gaussian Square pulse
    :math:`f_{active}(x)` with amplitude ``active_amp`` and phase ``active_angle``
    playing for the entire duration. The Gaussian Square Echo pulse :math:`g_e()`
    can be written as:

    .. math::

        \\begin{aligned}
        g_e(x) &= \\begin{cases}\
            f_{\\text{active}} + f_{\\text{echo}}(x)\
                & x < \\frac{\\text{duration}}{2}\\\\
            f_{\\text{active}} - f_{\\text{echo}}(x)\
                & \\frac{\\text{duration}}{2} < x\
        \\end{cases}\\\\
        \\end{aligned}

    One case where this pulse can be used is when implementing a direct CNOT gate with
    a cross-resonance superconducting qubit architecture. When applying this pulse to
    the target qubit, the active portion can be used to cancel IX terms from the
    cross-resonance drive while the echo portion can reduce the impact of a static ZZ coupling.

    Exactly one of the ``risefall_sigma_ratio`` and ``width`` parameters has to be specified.

    If ``risefall_sigma_ratio`` is not ``None`` and ``width`` is ``None``:

    .. math::

        \\begin{aligned}
        \\text{risefall} &= \\text{risefall\\_sigma\\_ratio} \\times \\text{sigma}\\\\
        \\text{width} &= \\text{duration} - 2 \\times \\text{risefall}
        \\end{aligned}

    If ``width`` is not None and ``risefall_sigma_ratio`` is None:

    .. math:: \\text{risefall} = \\frac{\\text{duration} - \\text{width}}{2}
