"""This library provides Pulse users with convenient methods to build Pulse waveforms.

Arbitrary waveforms can be described with :py:class:`~qiskit.pulse.library.Waveform` s.

The :py:mod:`~qiskit.pulse.library.discrete` module will generate
:py:class:`~qiskit.pulse.library.Waveform` s for common waveform envelopes.

The parametric pulses, :py:class:`~qiskit.pulse.library.Gaussian`,
:py:class:`~qiskit.pulse.library.GaussianSquare`, :py:class:`~qiskit.pulse.library.Drag` and
:py:class:`~qiskit.pulse.library.Constant` will generate parameterized descriptions of
those pulses, which can greatly reduce the size of the job sent to the backend.
