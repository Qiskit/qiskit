Pulse Targets & Frames (:mod:`qiskit.pulse.model`)
==========================================================

Pulse is meant to be agnostic to the underlying hardware implementation, while still allowing
low-level control. Qiskit Pulse's pulse targets and frames create a flexible framework
to define where pulse instructions are applied, and what would be their carrier frequency and phase
(because typically AC pulses are used). Each :class:`.PulseTarget` represents a separate component
in the quantum computing system on which instructions could be applied. On the other hand,
each :class:`.Frame` represents a frequency and phase duo for the carrier of the pulse.

While :class:`.PulseTarget` includes a :class`.Port` variant allowing for direct control over
hardware ports, an abstraction layer is provided by :class:`.LogicalElement`.
The abstraction allows to write pulse level programs with less knowledge of the hardware, and in
a level which is more similar to the circuit level programing. i.e., instead of specifying
ports, one can use Qubits, Couplers, etc.

This logical and virtual representation allows the user to write template pulse
programs without worrying about the exact details of the hardware implementation
(are the pulses to be played via the same port? Which NCO is used?), while still
allowing for effective utilization of the quantum hardware. The burden of mapping
the different combinations of :class:`.LogicalElement` and :class:`.Frame`
to hardware aware objects is left to the Pulse Compiler.

.. _pulse_targets:

PulseTarget
================
:class:`.PulseTarget` includes :class:`.Port` who's objects are identified by a unique string identifier
defined by the control system, and :class:`.LogicalElement` who's objects are identified by their type
and index. Currently, the most prominent example of a :class:`.LogicalElement` is the
:class:`~.pulse.Qubit`.

.. _frames:

Frame
=============
:class:`.Frame` s are identified by their type and unique identifier. A :class:`.GenericFrame` is used to
specify custom frequency
and phase duos, while :class:`.QubitFrame` and :class:`.MeasurementFrame` are used to indicate that
backend defaults are to be used (for the qubit's driving frequency and measurement frequency
respectively).

.. _mixed_frames:

MixedFrame
=============
The combination of a :class:`.LogicalElement` and :class:`.Frame` is dubbed a :class:`.MixedFrame`.
