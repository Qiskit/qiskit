This module defines Pulse Channels. Channels include:

  - transmit channels, which should subclass ``PulseChannel``
  - receive channels, such as ``AcquireChannel``
  - non-signal "channels" such as ``SnapshotChannel``, ``MemorySlot`` and ``RegisterChannel``.

Novel channel types can often utilize the ``ControlChannel``, but if this is not sufficient, new
channel types can be created. Then, they must be supported in the PulseQobj schema and the
assembler.
