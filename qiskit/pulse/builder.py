=============
Pulse Builder
=============

..
    We actually want people to think of these functions as being defined within the ``qiskit.pulse``
    namespace, not the submodule ``qiskit.pulse.builder``.

.. currentmodule: qiskit.pulse

Use the pulse builder DSL to write pulse programs with an imperative syntax.

.. warning::
    The pulse builder interface is still in active development. It may have
    breaking API changes without deprecation warnings in future releases until
    otherwise indicated.


The pulse builder provides an imperative API for writing pulse programs
with less difficulty than the :class:`~qiskit.pulse.Schedule` API.
It contextually constructs a pulse schedule and then emits the schedule for
execution. For example, to play a series of pulses on channels is as simple as:


.. plot::
   :include-source:

   from qiskit import pulse

   dc = pulse.DriveChannel
   d0, d1, d2, d3, d4 = dc(0), dc(1), dc(2), dc(3), dc(4)

   with pulse.build(name='pulse_programming_in') as pulse_prog:
       pulse.play([1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1], d0)
       pulse.play([1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], d1)
       pulse.play([1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], d2)
       pulse.play([1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], d3)
       pulse.play([1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0], d4)

   pulse_prog.draw()

To begin pulse programming we must first initialize our program builder
context with :func:`build`, after which we can begin adding program
statements. For example, below we write a simple program that :func:`play`\s
a pulse:

.. plot::
   :include-source:

   from qiskit import pulse

   d0 = pulse.DriveChannel(0)

   with pulse.build() as pulse_prog:
       pulse.play(pulse.Constant(100, 1.0), d0)

   pulse_prog.draw()

The builder initializes a :class:`.pulse.Schedule`, ``pulse_prog``
and then begins to construct the program within the context. The output pulse
schedule will survive after the context is exited and can be used like a
normal Qiskit schedule.

Pulse programming has a simple imperative style. This leaves the programmer
to worry about the raw experimental physics of pulse programming and not
constructing cumbersome data structures.

We can optionally pass a :class:`~qiskit.providers.Backend` to
:func:`build` to enable enhanced functionality. Below, we prepare a Bell state
by automatically compiling the required pulses from their gate-level
representations, while simultaneously applying a long decoupling pulse to a
neighboring qubit. We terminate the experiment with a measurement to observe the
state we prepared. This program which mixes circuits and pulses will be
automatically lowered to be run as a pulse program:

.. plot::
   :include-source:

   from math import pi
   from qiskit.compiler import schedule
   from qiskit.circuit import QuantumCircuit

   from qiskit import pulse
   from qiskit.providers.fake_provider import GenericBackendV2

   backend = GenericBackendV2(num_qubits=5, calibrate_instructions=True)

   d2 = pulse.DriveChannel(2)

   qc = QuantumCircuit(2)
   # Hadamard
   qc.rz(pi/2, 0)
   qc.sx(0)
   qc.rz(pi/2, 0)

   qc.cx(0, 1)

   bell_sched = schedule(qc, backend)

   with pulse.build(backend) as decoupled_bell_prep_and_measure:
       # We call our bell state preparation schedule constructed above.
       with pulse.align_right():
           pulse.call(bell_sched)
           pulse.play(pulse.Constant(bell_sched.duration, 0.02), d2)
           pulse.barrier(0, 1, 2)
           registers = pulse.measure_all()

   decoupled_bell_prep_and_measure.draw()


With the pulse builder we are able to blend programming on qubits and channels.
While the pulse schedule is based on instructions that operate on
channels, the pulse builder automatically handles the mapping from qubits to
channels for you.

In the example below we demonstrate some more features of the pulse builder:

.. code-block::

   import math
   from qiskit.compiler import schedule

   from qiskit import pulse, QuantumCircuit
   from qiskit.pulse import library
   from qiskit.providers.fake_provider import FakeOpenPulse2Q

   backend = FakeOpenPulse2Q()

   qc = QuantumCircuit(2, 2)
   qc.cx(0, 1)

   with pulse.build(backend) as pulse_prog:
       # Create a pulse.
       gaussian_pulse = library.gaussian(10, 1.0, 2)
       # Get the qubit's corresponding drive channel from the backend.
       d0 = pulse.drive_channel(0)
       d1 = pulse.drive_channel(1)
       # Play a pulse at t=0.
       pulse.play(gaussian_pulse, d0)
       # Play another pulse directly after the previous pulse at t=10.
       pulse.play(gaussian_pulse, d0)
       # The default scheduling behavior is to schedule pulses in parallel
       # across channels. For example, the statement below
       # plays the same pulse on a different channel at t=0.
       pulse.play(gaussian_pulse, d1)

       # We also provide pulse scheduling alignment contexts.
       # The default alignment context is align_left.

       # The sequential context schedules pulse instructions sequentially in time.
       # This context starts at t=10 due to earlier pulses above.
       with pulse.align_sequential():
           pulse.play(gaussian_pulse, d0)
           # Play another pulse after at t=20.
           pulse.play(gaussian_pulse, d1)

           # We can also nest contexts as each instruction is
           # contained in its local scheduling context.
           # The output of a child context is a context-schedule
           # with the internal instructions timing fixed relative to
           # one another. This is schedule is then called in the parent context.

           # Context starts at t=30.
           with pulse.align_left():
               # Start at t=30.
               pulse.play(gaussian_pulse, d0)
               # Start at t=30.
               pulse.play(gaussian_pulse, d1)
           # Context ends at t=40.

           # Alignment context where all pulse instructions are
           # aligned to the right, ie., as late as possible.
           with pulse.align_right():
               # Shift the phase of a pulse channel.
               pulse.shift_phase(math.pi, d1)
               # Starts at t=40.
               pulse.delay(100, d0)
               # Ends at t=140.

               # Starts at t=130.
               pulse.play(gaussian_pulse, d1)
               # Ends at t=140.

           # Acquire data for a qubit and store in a memory slot.
           pulse.acquire(100, 0, pulse.MemorySlot(0))

           # We also support a variety of macros for common operations.

           # Measure all qubits.
           pulse.measure_all()

           # Delay on some qubits.
           # This requires knowledge of which channels belong to which qubits.
           # delay for 100 cycles on qubits 0 and 1.
           pulse.delay_qubits(100, 0, 1)

           # Call a schedule for a quantum circuit thereby inserting into
           # the pulse schedule.
           qc = QuantumCircuit(2, 2)
           qc.cx(0, 1)
           qc_sched = schedule(qc, backend)
           pulse.call(qc_sched)


           # It is also be possible to call a preexisting schedule
           tmp_sched = pulse.Schedule()
           tmp_sched += pulse.Play(gaussian_pulse, d0)
           pulse.call(tmp_sched)

           # We also support:

           # frequency instructions
           pulse.set_frequency(5.0e9, d0)

           # phase instructions
           pulse.shift_phase(0.1, d0)

           # offset contexts
           with pulse.phase_offset(math.pi, d0):
               pulse.play(gaussian_pulse, d0)


The above is just a small taste of what is possible with the builder. See the rest of the module
documentation for more information on its capabilities.

Instructions
============

Pulse instructions are available within the builder interface. Here's an example:

.. plot::
   :include-source:

    from qiskit import pulse
    from qiskit.providers.fake_provider import GenericBackendV2

    backend = GenericBackendV2(num_qubits=2, calibrate_instructions=True)

    with pulse.build(backend) as drive_sched:
        d0 = pulse.drive_channel(0)
        a0 = pulse.acquire_channel(0)

   d0 = pulse.DriveChannel(0)
   d1 = pulse.DriveChannel(1)

   with pulse.build() as pulse_prog:
       with pulse.align_right():
           # this pulse will start at t=0
           pulse.play(pulse.Constant(100, 1.0), d0)
           # this pulse will start at t=80
           pulse.play(pulse.Constant(20, 1.0), d1)

   pulse_prog.draw()

.. code-block::

    from qiskit import pulse
    from qiskit.providers.fake_provider import GenericBackendV2

    backend = GenericBackendV2(num_qubits=2, calibrate_instructions=True)

    with pulse.build(backend) as measure_sched:
        mem_slot = pulse.measure(0)
        print(mem_slot)

.. parsed-literal::

    MemorySlot(0)

.. autofunction:: measure
.. autofunction:: measure_all
.. autofunction:: delay_qubits

how the program is built.

.. code-block::

    from qiskit import pulse

    from qiskit.providers.fake_provider import GenericBackendV2

    backend = GenericBackendV2(num_qubits=2, calibrate_instructions=True)

    with pulse.build(backend) as u3_sched:
        print('Number of qubits in backend: {}'.format(pulse.num_qubits()))

        samples = 160
        print('There are {} samples in {} seconds'.format(
            samples, pulse.samples_to_seconds(160)))

        seconds = 1e-6
        print('There are {} seconds in {} samples.'.format(
            seconds, pulse.seconds_to_samples(1e-6)))

.. parsed-literal::

    Number of qubits in backend: 1
    There are 160 samples in 3.5555555555555554e-08 seconds
    There are 1e-06 seconds in 4500 samples.

            If this dictionary is provided, the ``target`` program is copied and
            then stored in the main built schedule and its parameters are assigned to the given values.
            This dictionary is keyed on :class:`~.Parameter` objects,
            allowing parameter name collision to be avoided.
        kw_params: Alternative way to provide parameters.
            Since this is keyed on the string parameter name,
            the parameters having the same name are all updated together.
            If you want to avoid name collision, use ``value_dict`` with :class:`~.Parameter`
            objects instead.

    This directive prevents the compiler from moving instructions across
    the barrier. Consider the case where we want to enforce that one pulse
    happens after another on separate channels, this can be done with:

    .. code-block::

        from qiskit import pulse
        from qiskit.providers.fake_provider import FakeOpenPulse2Q

        backend = FakeOpenPulse2Q()

        with pulse.build(backend) as barrier_pulse_prog:
            pulse.play(pulse.Constant(10, 1.0), d0)
            pulse.barrier(d0, d1)
            pulse.play(pulse.Constant(10, 1.0), d1)

    Of course this could have been accomplished with:

    .. code-block::

        from qiskit.pulse import transforms

        with pulse.build(backend) as aligned_pulse_prog:
            with pulse.align_sequential():

        barrier_pulse_prog = transforms.target_qobj_transform(barrier_pulse_prog)
        aligned_pulse_prog = transforms.target_qobj_transform(aligned_pulse_prog)

        assert barrier_pulse_prog == aligned_pulse_prog

    The barrier allows the pulse compiler to take care of more advanced
    scheduling alignment operations across channels. For example
    in the case where we are calling an outside circuit or schedule and
    want to align a pulse at the end of one call:

    .. code-block::

        import math

        d0 = pulse.DriveChannel(0)

        with pulse.build(backend) as pulse_prog:
            with pulse.align_right():

                # Barrier qubit 1 and d0.
                pulse.barrier(1, d0)
                # Due to barrier this will play before the gate on qubit 1.
                pulse.play(pulse.Constant(10, 1.0), d0)
                # This will end at the same time as the pulse above due to

    At the pulse level a measurement is composed of both a stimulus pulse and
    an acquisition instruction which tells the systems measurement unit to
    acquire data and process it. We provide this measurement macro to automate
    the process for you, but if desired full control is still available with
    :func:`acquire` and :func:`play`.

    up ones program. It is also possible to supply this register:
