r"""Use the pulse builder DSL to write pulse programs with an imperative syntax.

.. warning::
    The pulse builder interface is still in active development. It may have
    breaking API changes without deprecation warnings in future releases until
    otherwise indicated.

To begin pulse programming we must first initialize our program builder
context with :func:`build`, after which we can begin adding program
statements. For example, below we write a simple program that :func:`play`\s
a pulse:

.. jupyter-execute::

    from qiskit import execute, pulse

    d0 = pulse.DriveChannel(0)

    with pulse.build() as pulse_prog:
        pulse.play(pulse.Constant(100, 1.0), d0)

    pulse_prog.draw()

The builder initializes a :class:`pulse.Schedule`, ``pulse_prog``
and then begins to construct the program within the context. The output pulse
schedule will survive after the context is exited and can be executed like a
normal Qiskit schedule using ``qiskit.execute(pulse_prog, backend)``.

Pulse programming has a simple imperative style. This leaves the programmer
to worry about the raw experimental physics of pulse programming and not
constructing cumbersome data structures.

We can optionally pass a :class:`~qiskit.providers.BaseBackend` to
:func:`build` to enable enhanced functionality. Below, we prepare a Bell state
by automatically compiling the required pulses from their gate-level
representations, while simultaneously applying a long decoupling pulse to a
neighboring qubit. We terminate the experiment with a measurement to observe the
state we prepared. This program which mixes circuits and pulses will be
automatically lowered to be run as a pulse program:

.. jupyter-execute::

    import math

    from qiskit import pulse
    from qiskit.test.mock import FakeOpenPulse3Q

    # TODO: This example should use a real mock backend.
    backend = FakeOpenPulse3Q()

    d2 = pulse.DriveChannel(2)

    with pulse.build(backend) as bell_prep:
        pulse.u2(0, math.pi, 0)
        pulse.cx(0, 1)

    with pulse.build(backend) as decoupled_bell_prep_and_measure:
        # We call our bell state preparation schedule constructed above.
        with pulse.align_right():
            pulse.call(bell_prep)
            pulse.play(pulse.Constant(bell_prep.duration, 0.02), d2)
            pulse.barrier(0, 1, 2)
            registers = pulse.measure_all()

    decoupled_bell_prep_and_measure.draw()

With the pulse builder we are able to blend programming on qubits and channels.
While the pulse schedule is based on instructions that operate on
channels, the pulse builder automatically handles the mapping from qubits to
channels for you.

In the example below we demonstrate some more features of the pulse builder:

.. jupyter-execute::

    import math

    from qiskit import pulse, QuantumCircuit
    from qiskit.pulse import library
    from qiskit.test.mock import FakeOpenPulse2Q

    backend = FakeOpenPulse2Q()

    with pulse.build(backend) as pulse_prog:
        # Create a pulse.
        gaussian_pulse = library.gaussian(10, 1.0, 2)
        # Get the qubit's corresponding drive channel from the backend.
        d0 = pulse.drive_channel(0)
        d1 = pulse.drive_channel(1)
        # Play a pulse at t=0.
        pulse.play(gaussian_pulse, d0)
        # Play another pulse directly after the previous pulse at t=10.
        pulse.play(gaussian_pulse, d0)
        # The default scheduling behavior is to schedule pulses in parallel
        # across channels. For example, the statement below
        # plays the same pulse on a different channel at t=0.
        pulse.play(gaussian_pulse, d1)

        # We also provide pulse scheduling alignment contexts.
        # The default alignment context is align_left.

        # The sequential context schedules pulse instructions sequentially in time.
        # This context starts at t=10 due to earlier pulses above.
        with pulse.align_sequential():
            pulse.play(gaussian_pulse, d0)
            # Play another pulse after at t=20.
            pulse.play(gaussian_pulse, d1)

            # We can also nest contexts as each instruction is
            # contained in its local scheduling context.
            # The output of a child context is a context-schedule
            # with the internal instructions timing fixed relative to
            # one another. This is schedule is then called in the parent context.

            # Context starts at t=30.
            with pulse.align_left():
                # Start at t=30.
                pulse.play(gaussian_pulse, d0)
                # Start at t=30.
                pulse.play(gaussian_pulse, d1)
            # Context ends at t=40.

            # Alignment context where all pulse instructions are
            # aligned to the right, ie., as late as possible.
            with pulse.align_right():
                # Shift the phase of a pulse channel.
                pulse.shift_phase(math.pi, d1)
                # Starts at t=40.
                pulse.delay(100, d0)
                # Ends at t=140.

                # Starts at t=130.
                pulse.play(gaussian_pulse, d1)
                # Ends at t=140.

            # Acquire data for a qubit and store in a memory slot.
            pulse.acquire(100, 0, pulse.MemorySlot(0))

            # We also support a variety of macros for common operations.

            # Measure all qubits.
            pulse.measure_all()

            # Delay on some qubits.
            # This requires knowledge of which channels belong to which qubits.
            # delay for 100 cycles on qubits 0 and 1.
            pulse.delay_qubits(100, 0, 1)

            # Call a quantum circuit. The pulse builder lazily constructs a quantum
            # circuit which is then transpiled and scheduled before inserting into
            # a pulse schedule.
            # NOTE: Quantum register indices correspond to physical qubit indices.
            qc = QuantumCircuit(2, 2)
            qc.cx(0, 1)
            pulse.call(qc)
            # Calling a small set of standard gates and decomposing to pulses is
            # also supported with more natural syntax.
            pulse.u3(0, math.pi, 0, 0)
            pulse.cx(0, 1)


            # It is also be possible to call a preexisting schedule
            tmp_sched = pulse.Schedule()
            tmp_sched += pulse.Play(gaussian_pulse, d0)
            pulse.call(tmp_sched)

            # We also support:

            # frequency instructions
            pulse.set_frequency(5.0e9, d0)

            # phase instructions
            pulse.shift_phase(0.1, d0)

            # offset contexts
            with pulse.phase_offset(math.pi, d0):
                pulse.play(gaussian_pulse, d0)

The above is just a small taste of what is possible with the builder. See the
rest of the module documentation for more information on its
capabilities.

    :func:`acquire` and :func:`play`.
