    This is designed to be used by both :class:`.QuantumCircuit` and :class:`.DAGCircuit` when
    managing operations that need to map classical resources from one circuit to another.

    The general usage is to initialise this at the start of a many-block mapping operation, then
    call its :meth:`map_condition`, :meth:`map_target` or :meth:`map_expr` methods as appropriate,
    which will return the new object that should be used.

    If an ``add_register`` callable is given to the initialiser, the mapper will use it to attempt
    to add new aliasing registers to the outer circuit object, if there is not already a suitable
    register for the mapping available in the circuit.  If this parameter is not given, a
    ``ValueError`` will be raised instead.  The given ``add_register`` callable may choose to raise
    its own exception."""
