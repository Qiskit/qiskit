ClassicalFunction compiler (:mod:`qiskit.circuit.classicalfunction`)
====================================================================

.. currentmodule:: qiskit.circuit.classicalfunction

Overview
========

The classical function compiler provides the necessary tools to map a classical
irreversible functions into quantum circuits.  Below is a simple example of
how to synthesize a simple boolean function defined using Python into a
QuantumCircuit:

   .. jupyter-execute::

      from qiskit.circuit import classical_function,  Int1

      @classical_function
      def grover_oracle(a: Int1, b: Int1, c: Int1, d: Int1) -> Int1:
          return (not a and b and not c and d)

      quantum_circuit = grover_oracle.synth()
      quantum_circuit.draw()

Following Qiskit's little-endian bit ordering convention, the left-most bit (`a`) is the most
significant bit and the right-most bit (`d`) is the least significant bit. The resulting

      **Tweedledum**

   Tweedledum is a C++-17 header-only library that implements a large set of
   reversible (and quantum) synthesis, optimization, and mapping algorithms.
   The classical function compiler relies on it and its dependencies to both represent logic
   networks and synthesize them into quantum circuits.

      **ClassicalFunction data types**

   At the moment, the only type supported by the classical_function compilers is
   ``qiskit.circuit.classicalfunction.types.Int1``. The classical function function
   to parse *must* include type hints (just ``Int1`` for now). The resulting gate
   will be a gate in the size of the sum of all the parameters and the return.

   The type ``Int1`` means the classical function will only operate at bit level.
