    This function will generate a random circuit by randomly selecting gates
    from the set of standard gates in :mod:`qiskit.extensions`. For example:

    .. jupyter-execute::

        from qiskit.circuit.random import random_circuit

        circ = random_circuit(2, 2, measure=True)
        circ.draw(output='mpl')

    Args:
        num_qubits (int): number of quantum wires
        depth (int): layers of operations (i.e. critical path length)
        max_operands (int): maximum operands of each gate (between 1 and 3)
        measure (bool): if True, measure all qubits at the end
        conditional (bool): if True, insert middle measurements and conditionals
        reset (bool): if True, insert middle resets
        seed (int): sets random seed (optional)

    Returns:
        QuantumCircuit: constructed circuit
