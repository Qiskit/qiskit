    controlling each gate in the decomposition.

    Open controls are implemented by conjugating the control line with
    X gates. Adds num_ctrl_qubits controls to operation.

        num_ctrl_qubits: The number of controls to add to gate.
        label: An optional gate label.
        ctrl_state: The control state in decimal or as a bitstring
            (e.g. '111'). If specified as a bitstring the length
            must equal num_ctrl_qubits, MSB on left. If None, use
