class UnitaryOverlap(QuantumCircuit):
    r"""Circuit that returns the overlap between two unitaries :math:`U_2^{\dag} U_1`.

    The input quantum circuits must represent unitary operations, since they must be invertible.
    If the inputs will have parameters, they are replaced by :class:`.ParameterVector`\s with
    names `"p1"` (for circuit ``unitary1``) and `"p2"` (for circuit ``unitary_2``) in the output
    circuit.

    This circuit is usually employed in computing the fidelity:

    .. math::

        \left|\langle 0| U_2^{\dag} U_1|0\rangle\right|^{2}

    by computing the probability of being in the all-zeros bit-string, or equivalently,
    the expectation value of projector :math:`|0\rangle\langle 0|`.

    Example::

        import numpy as np
        from qiskit.circuit.library import EfficientSU2, UnitaryOverlap
        from qiskit.primitives import Sampler

        # get two circuit to prepare states of which we compute the overlap
        circuit = EfficientSU2(2, reps=1)
        unitary1 = circuit.assign_parameters(np.random.random(circuit.num_parameters))
        unitary2 = circuit.assign_parameters(np.random.random(circuit.num_parameters))

        # create the overlap circuit
        overlap = UnitaryOverlap(unitary1, unitary2)

        # sample from the overlap
        sampler = Sampler(options={"shots": 100})
        result = sampler.run(overlap).result()

        # the fidelity is the probability to measure 0
        fidelity = result.quasi_dists[0].get(0, 0)
