    Diagonal gates are useful as representations of Boolean functions,
    as they can map from {0,1}^2**n to {0,1}^2**n space. For example a phase
    oracle can be seen as a diagonal gate with {+1, -1} on the diagonals. Such
    an oracle will induce a +1 or -1 phase on the amplitude of any corresponding
    basis state.

    Diagonal gates appear in many classically hard oracular problems such as
    Forrelation or Hidden Shift circuits.

    Diagonal gates are represented and simulated more efficiently than a dense
    2**n x 2**n unitary matrix.

    The reference implementation is via the method described in
    Theorem 7 of [1].
