class FourierChecking(QuantumCircuit):
    """Fourier checking circuit.

    The circuit for the Fourier checking algorithm, introduced in [1],
    involves a layer of Hadamards, the function :math:`f`, another layer of
    Hadamards, the function :math:`g`, followed by a final layer of Hadamards.
    The functions :math:`f` and :math:`g` are classical functions realized
    as phase oracles (diagonal operators with {-1, 1} on the diagonal).

    The probability of observing the all-zeros string is :math:`p(f,g)`.
    The algorithm solves the promise Fourier checking problem,
    which decides if f is correlated with the Fourier transform
    of g, by testing if :math:`p(f,g) <= 0.01` or :math:`p(f,g) >= 0.05`,
    promised that one or the other of these is true.

    The functions :math:`f` and :math:`g` are currently implemented
    from their truth tables but could be represented concisely and
    implemented efficiently for special classes of functions.

    Fourier checking is a special case of :math:`k`-fold forrelation [2].
