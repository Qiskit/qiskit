    The global R gate is native to atomic systems (ion traps, cold neutrals). The global R
    can be applied to multiple qubits simultaneously.

    In the one-qubit case, this is equivalent to an R(theta, phi) operation,
    and is thus reduced to the RGate. The global R gate is a direct sum of R
    operations on all individual qubits.
