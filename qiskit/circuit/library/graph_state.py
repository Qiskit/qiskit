class GraphState(QuantumCircuit):
    r"""Circuit to prepare a graph state.

    Given a graph G = (V, E), with the set of vertices V and the set of edges E,
    the corresponding graph state is defined as

    .. math::

        |G\rangle = \prod_{(a,b) \in E} CZ_{(a,b)} {|+\rangle}^{\otimes V}

    Such a state can be prepared by first preparing all qubits in the :math:`+`
    state, then applying a :math:`CZ` gate for each corresponding graph edge.

    Graph state preparation circuits are Clifford circuits, and thus
    easy to simulate classically. However, by adding a layer of measurements
    in a product basis at the end, there is evidence that the circuit becomes
    hard to simulate [2].
