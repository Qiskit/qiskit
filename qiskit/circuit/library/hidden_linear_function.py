class HiddenLinearFunction(QuantumCircuit):
    r"""Circuit to solve the hidden linear function problem.

    The 2D Hidden Linear Function problem is determined by a 2D adjacency
    matrix A, where only elements that are nearest-neighbor on a grid have
    non-zero entries. Each row/column corresponds to one binary variable
    :math:`x_i`.

    The hidden linear function problem is as follows:

    Consider the quadratic form

    .. math::

        q(x) = \sum_{i,j=1}^{n}{x_i x_j} ~(\mathrm{mod}~ 4)

    and restrict :math:`q(x)` onto the nullspace of A. This results in a linear
    function.

    .. math::

        2 \sum_{i=1}^{n}{z_i x_i} ~(\mathrm{mod}~ 4)  \forall  x \in \mathrm{Ker}(A)

    and the goal is to recover this linear function (equivalently a vector
    :math:`[z_0, ..., z_{n-1}]`). There can be multiple solutions.

    In [1] it is shown that the present circuit solves this problem
    on a quantum computer in constant depth, whereas any corresponding
    solution on a classical computer would require circuits that grow
    logarithmically with :math:`n`. Thus this circuit is an example
    of quantum advantage with shallow circuits.
