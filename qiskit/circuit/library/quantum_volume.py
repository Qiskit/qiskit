    """A quantum volume model circuit.

    The model circuits are random instances of circuits used to measure
    the Quantum Volume metric, as introduced in [1].

    The model circuits consist of layers of Haar random
    elements of SU(4) applied between corresponding pairs
    of qubits in a random bipartition.
