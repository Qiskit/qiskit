    This function is multithreaded and will launch a thread pool with threads equal to the number
    of CPUs by default. You can tune the number of threads with the ``RAYON_NUM_THREADS``
    environment variable. For example, setting ``RAYON_NUM_THREADS=4`` would limit the thread pool
    to 4 threads.

        num_qubits: The number qubits to use for the generated circuit.
        depth: The number of layers for the generated circuit. If this
            is not specified it will default to ``num_qubits`` layers.

            matrices used in the output circuit. This can be either an
            integer or a numpy generator. If an integer is specfied it must
