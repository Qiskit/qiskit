class AND(QuantumCircuit):
    r"""A circuit implementing the logical AND operation on a number of qubits.

    For the AND operation the state :math:`|1\rangle` is interpreted as ``True``. The result
    qubit is flipped, if the state of all variable qubits is ``True``. In this format, the AND
    operation equals a multi-controlled X gate, which is controlled on all variable qubits.
    Using a list of flags however, qubits can be skipped or negated. Practically, the flags
    allow to skip controls or to apply pre- and post-X gates to the negated qubits.

    The AND gate without special flags equals the multi-controlled-X gate:

       from qiskit.visualization.library import _generate_circuit_library_visualization
       circuit = AND(5)
       _generate_circuit_library_visualization(circuit)

    Using flags we can negate qubits or skip them. For instance, if we have 5 qubits and want to
    return ``True`` if the first qubit is ``False`` and the last two are ``True`` we use the flags
    ``[-1, 0, 0, 1, 1]``.
