    """Pauli Product Measurement instruction.

    A Pauli Product Measurement is a fundamental operation in fault-tolerant quantum
    computing. Mathematically, it corresponds to a joint projective measurement on
    multiple qubits, where the measured observable is a tensor product of Pauli operators.
    The outcome of this measurement is a single eigenvalue, either :math:`+1` or :math:`-1`,
    indicating the eigenstate of the Pauli product.

            pauli: A tensor product of Pauli operators defining the measurement,

                The identity Pauli operator is not permitted.
                The Pauli may include a phase of :math:`-1`, but not :math:`i` or :math:`-i`.

            While Paulis involving ``"I"``-terms are fully supported, it is recommended to remove
            ``"I"``-terms from the Pauli when creating a ``PauliProductMeasurement`` instruction,
            as this does not change the actual measurement but specifies the instruction over
            a smaller set of qubits.
