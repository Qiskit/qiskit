def _compute_control_matrix(base_mat, num_ctrl_qubits, ctrl_state=None):
    r"""
    Compute the controlled version of the input matrix with qiskit ordering.
    This function computes the controlled unitary with :math:`n` control qubits
    and :math:`m` target qubits,

    .. math::

        V_n^j(U_{2^m}) = (U_{2^m} \otimes |j\rangle\!\langle j|) +
                         (I_{2^m} \otimes (I_{2^n} - |j\rangle\!\langle j|)).

    where :math:`|j\rangle \in \mathcal{H}^{2^n}` is the control state.

    Args:
        base_mat (ndarray): unitary to be controlled
        num_ctrl_qubits (int): number of controls for new unitary
        ctrl_state (int or str or None): The control state in decimal or as
            a bitstring (e.g. '111'). If None, use 2**num_ctrl_qubits-1.

    Returns:
        ndarray: controlled version of base matrix.

    Raises:
        QiskitError: unrecognized mode or invalid ctrl_state
