    This class is designed only to be used by :obj:`.QuantumCircuit` as an internal context for

    than that.

    Note that the instructions that are added to this scope may not be valid yet, so this elides
    some of the type-checking of :obj:`.QuantumCircuit` until those things are known.

    The general principle of the resource tracking through these builder blocks is that every
    necessary resource should pass through an :meth:`.append` call, so that at the point that
    :meth:`.build` is called, the scope knows all the concrete resources that it requires.  However,
    the scope can also contain "placeholder" instructions, which may need extra resources filling in
    from outer scopes (such as a ``break`` needing to know the width of its containing ``for``
    loop).  This means that :meth:`.build` takes all the *containing* scope's resources as well.
    This does not break the "all resources pass through an append" rule, because the containing
    scope will only begin to build its instructions once it has received them all.

    In short, :meth:`.append` adds resources, and :meth:`.build` may use only a subset of the extra
    ones passed.  This ensures that all instructions know about all the resources they need, even in
    the case of ``break``, but do not block any resources that they do *not* need.

        others.

        The ``qubits`` and ``clbits`` arguments should be sets that contains all the resources in
        the outer scope; these will be passed down to inner placeholder instructions, so they can
        apply themselves across the whole scope should they need to.  The resulting
        :obj:`.QuantumCircuit` will be defined over a (nonstrict) subset of these resources.  This
        is used to let ``break`` and ``continue`` span all resources, even if they are nested within
        several :obj:`.IfElsePlaceholder` objects, without requiring :obj:`.IfElsePlaceholder`
        objects *without* any ``break`` or ``continue`` statements to be full-width.

        Args:
            all_qubits: all the qubits in the containing scope of this block.  The block may expand
                to use some or all of these qubits, but will never gain qubits that are not in this
                set.
            all_clbits: all the clbits in the containing scope of this block.  The block may expand
                to use some or all of these clbits, but will never gain clbits that are not in this
                set.

        Returns:
            A circuit containing concrete versions of all the instructions that were in the scope,
            and using the minimal set of resources necessary to support them, within the enclosing
            scope.
