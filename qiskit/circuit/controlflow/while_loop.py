class WhileLoopOp(ControlFlowOp):
    """A circuit operation which repeatedly executes a subcircuit (``body``) until
    a condition (``condition``) evaluates as False.

    Parameters:
        condition: A condition to be checked prior to executing ``body``. Can be
            specified as either a tuple of a ``ClassicalRegister`` to be tested
            for equality with a given ``int``, or as a tuple of a ``Clbit`` to
            be compared to either a ``bool`` or an ``int``.
        body: The loop body to be repeatedly executed.
        label: An optional label for identifying the instruction.

    The classical bits used in ``condition`` must be a subset of those attached
    to ``body``.

class WhileLoopContext:
    """A context manager for building up while loops onto circuits in a natural order, without
    having to construct the loop body first.

    Within the block, a lot of the bookkeeping is done for you; you do not need to keep track of
    which qubits and clbits you are using, for example.  All normal methods of accessing the qubits
    on the underlying :obj:`~QuantumCircuit` will work correctly, and resolve into correct accesses
    within the interior block.

    You generally should never need to instantiate this object directly.  Instead, use
    :obj:`.QuantumCircuit.while_loop` in its context-manager form, i.e. by not supplying a ``body``
    or sets of qubits and clbits.

    Example usage::

        from qiskit.circuit import QuantumCircuit, Clbit, Qubit
        bits = [Qubit(), Qubit(), Clbit()]
        qc = QuantumCircuit(bits)

        with qc.while_loop((bits[2], 0)):
            qc.h(0)

            qc.measure(0, 0)
