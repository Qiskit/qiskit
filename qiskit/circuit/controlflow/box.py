    A "box" is a control-flow construct that is entered unconditionally.  The contents of the box
    behave somewhat as if the start and end of the box were barriers, except it is permissible to
    commute operations "all the way" through the box.  The box is also an explicit scope for the
    purposes of variables, stretches and compiler passes.

    A box may be "annotated" with arbitrary user-defined custom :class:`.Annotation` objects.  In
    cases where order is important, these should be interpreted by applying the first annotation in
    the list first, then the second, and so on.  It is generally recommended that annotations should
    not be order-dependent, wherever possible.

    Typically you create this by using the builder-interface form of :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.box`.
