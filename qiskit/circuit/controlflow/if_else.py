    Parameters:
        condition: A condition to be evaluated at circuit runtime which,
            if true, will trigger the evaluation of ``true_body``. Can be
            specified as either a tuple of a ``ClassicalRegister`` to be
            tested for equality with a given ``int``, or as a tuple of a
            ``Clbit`` to be compared to either a ``bool`` or an ``int``.
        true_body: A program to be executed if ``condition`` evaluates
            to true.
        false_body: A optional program to be executed if ``condition``
            evaluates to false.
        label: An optional label for identifying the instruction.

    If provided, ``false_body`` must be of the same ``num_qubits`` and
    ``num_clbits`` as ``true_body``.

    The classical bits used in ``condition`` must be a subset of those attached
    to the circuit on which this ``IfElseOp`` will be appended.
