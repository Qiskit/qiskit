Singleton instructions (:mod:`qiskit.circuit.singleton`)
========================================================

.. currentmodule:: qiskit.circuit.singleton

The machinery in this module is for defining subclasses of :class:`~.circuit.Instruction` and
:class:`.Gate` that preferentially return a shared immutable singleton instance when instantiated.
Taking the example of :class:`.XGate`, the final user-facing result is that:

* There is a regular class called :class:`XGate`, which derives from :class:`.Gate`.

* Doing something like ``XGate(label="my_gate")`` produces an object whose type is exactly
  ``XGate``, and all the mutability works completely as expected; all the methods resolve to exactly
  those defined by :class:`.XGate`, :class:`.Gate`, or parents.

* Doing ``XGate()`` produces a singleton object whose type is a synthetic ``_SingletonXGate`` class,
  which derives :class:`.XGate` but overrides :meth:`~object.__setattr__` to make itself immutable.
  The object itself has precisely the same instance attributes as ``XGate()`` would have if there
  was no singleton handling.  This object will return itself under :func:`~copy.copy`,
  :func:`~copy.deepcopy` and roundtrip through :mod:`pickle`.

The same can be true for, for example, :class:`.Measure`, except that it's a subclass of
:class:`~.circuit.Instruction` only, and not :class:`.Gate`.

.. note::

    The classes in this module are for advanced use, because they are closely entwined with the
    heart of Qiskit's data model for circuits.

From a library-author perspective, the minimum that is needed to enhance a :class:`.Gate` or
:class:`~.circuit.Instruction` with this behaviour is to inherit from :class:`SingletonGate`
(:class:`SingletonInstruction`) instead of :class:`.Gate` (:class:`~.circuit.Instruction`), and for
the ``__init__`` method to have defaults for all of its arguments (these will be the state of the
singleton instance).  For example::

    class XGate(SingletonGate):
        def __init__(self, label=None):
            super().__init__("x", 1, [], label=label)

    assert XGate() is XGate()


Interface
=========

The public classes correspond to the standard classes :class:`~.circuit.Instruction` and
:class:`.Gate`, respectively, and are subclasses of these.

.. autoclass:: SingletonInstruction
   :class-doc-from: class
.. autoclass:: SingletonGate
   :class-doc-from: class
.. autoclass:: SingletonControlledGate
   :class-doc-from: class

When inheriting from one of these classes, the produced class will have an eagerly created singleton
instance that will be returned whenever the class is constructed with arguments that have been
defined to be singletons.  Typically this will be the defaults.  These instances are immutable;
attempts to modify their properties will raise :exc:`TypeError`.

*All* subclasses of :class:`~.circuit.Instruction` have a :attr:`~.Instruction.mutable` property.
For most instructions this is ``True``, while for the singleton instances it is ``False``.  One can
use the :meth:`~.Instruction.to_mutable` method to get a version of the instruction that is owned
and safe to mutate.

The singleton instances are not exact instances of their base class; they are special subclasses
that cannot construct new objects.  This means that::

    type(XGate()) is not XGate

You should not rely on :class:`type` having an exact value; use :func:`isinstance` instead for type
checking.  If you need to reliably retrieve the base class from an :class:`~.circuit.Instruction`,
see the :attr:`.Instruction.base_class` attribute; singleton instances set this correctly.  For most
cases in using Qiskit, :attr:`.Instruction.name` is a more suitable determiner of what an
instruction "means" in a circuit.

Deriving new singletons
-----------------------

The simplest example of deriving a new singleton instruction is simply to inherit from the correct
base and supply an :meth:`~object.__init__` method that has immutable defaults for any arguments.
For example::

    from qiskit.circuit.singleton import SingletonInstruction

    class MyInstruction(SingletonInstruction):
        def __init__(self, label=None):
            super().__init__("my_instruction", 1, 0, label=label)

    assert MyInstruction() is MyInstruction()
    assert MyInstruction(label="some label") is not MyInstruction()
    assert MyInstruction(label="some label").mutable

The singleton instance will use all the constructor's defaults.

You can also derive from an instruction that is itself a singleton.  The singleton nature of the
class will be inherited, though the singleton instances of the two classes will be different::

    class MyOtherInstruction(MyInstruction):
        pass

    assert MyOtherInstruction() is MyOtherInstruction()
    assert MyOtherInstruction() is not MyInstruction()

If for some reason you want to derive from :class:`SingletonInstruction`, or one of the related or
subclasses but *do not* want the default singleton instance to be created, such as if you are
defining a new abstract base class, you can set the keyword argument
``create_default_singleton=False`` in the class definition::

    class NotASingleton(SingletonInstruction, create_default_singleton=False):
        def __init__(self):
            return super().__init__("my_mutable", 1, 0, [])

    assert NotASingleton() is not NotASingleton()

If your constructor does not have defaults for all its arguments, you must set
``create_default_singleton=False``.

Subclasses of :class:`SingletonInstruction` and the other associated classes can control how their
constructor's arguments are interpreted, in order to help the singleton machinery return the
singleton even in the case than an optional argument is explicitly set to its default.

.. automethod:: SingletonInstruction._singleton_lookup_key

This is set by all Qiskit standard-library gates such that the :attr:`~Instruction.label` and
similar keyword arguments are ignored in the key calculation if they are their defaults, or a
mutable instance is returned if they are not.

You can also specify other combinations of constructor arguments to produce singleton instances
for, using the ``additional_singletons`` argument in the class definition.  This takes an iterable
of ``(args, kwargs)`` tuples, and will build singletons equivalent to ``cls(*args, **kwargs)``.  You
do not need to handle the case of the default arguments with this.  For example, given a class
definition::

    class MySingleton(SingletonGate, additional_singletons=[((2,), {"label": "two"})]):
        def __init__(self, n=1, label=None):
            super().__init__("my", n, [], label=label)

        @staticmethod
        def _singleton_lookup_key(n=1, label=None):
            return (n, label)

there will be two singleton instances instantiated.  One corresponds to ``n=1`` and ``label=None``,
and the other to ``n=2`` and ``label="two"``.  Whenever ``MySingleton`` is constructed with
arguments consistent with one of those two cases, the relevant singleton will be returned.  For
example::

    assert MySingleton() is MySingleton(1, label=None)
    assert MySingleton(2, "two") is MySingleton(n=2, label="two")

The case of the class being instantiated with zero arguments is handled specially to allow an
absolute fast-path for inner-loop performance (although the general machinery is not desperately
slow anyway).


Implementation
==============

.. note::

    This section is primarily developer documentation for the code; none of the machinery described
    here is public, and it is not safe to inherit from any of it directly.

There are several moving parts to tackle here.  The behaviour of having ``XGate()`` return some
singleton object that is an (inexact) instance of :class:`.XGate` but *without* calling ``__init__``
requires us to override :class:`type.__call__ <type>`.  This means that :class:`.XGate` must have a
metaclass that defines ``__call__`` to return the singleton instance.

Next, we need to ensure that there *is* a singleton instance for ``XGate()`` to return.  This can be
done dynamically on each call (i.e. check if the instance exists and create it if not), but since
we also want that instance to be very special, it's easier to hook in and create it during the
definition of the ``XGate`` type object.  This also has the advantage that we do not need to make
the singleton object pickleable; we only need to specify where to retrieve it from during the
unpickle, because the creation of the base type object will recreate the singleton.

We want the singleton instance to:

* be immutable; it should reject all attempts to mutate itself.
* have exactly the same state as an ``XGate()`` would have had if there was no singleton handling.

We do this in a three-step procedure:

1. Before creating any singletons, we separately define the overrides needed to make an
   :class:`~.circuit.Instruction` and a :class:`.Gate` immutable.  This is
   ``_SingletonInstructionOverrides`` and the other ``_*Overrides`` classes.

2. While we are creating the ``XGate`` type object, we dynamically *also* create a subclass of it
   that has the immutable overrides in its method-resolution order in the correct place. These
   override the standard methods / properties that are defined on the mutable gate (we do not
   attempt to override any cases where the type object we are creating has extra inplace methods).

3. We can't instantiate this new subclass, because when it calls ``XGate.__init__``, it will attempt
   to set some attributes, and these will be rejected by immutability.  Instead, we first create a
   completely regular ``XGate`` instance, and then we dynamically change its type to the singleton
   class, freezing it.

We could do this entirely within the metaclass machinery, but that would require ``XGate`` to be
defined as something like::

  class XGate(Gate, metaclass=_SingletonMeta, overrides=_SingletonGateOverrides): ...

which is super inconvenient (or we'd have to have ``_SingletonMeta`` do a bunch of fragile
introspection).  Instead, we use the :class:`abc.ABC`/:class:`abc.ABCMeta` pattern of defining a
concrete middle class (:class:`SingletonGate` in the :class:`.XGate` case) that sets the metaclass,
selects the overrides to be applied, and has an :meth:`~object.__init_subclass__` that applies the
singleton-subclass-creation steps above.  The overrides are in separate classes so that *mutable*
:class:`.XGate` instances do not have them in their own method-resolution orders; doing this is
easier to implement, but requires all the setters and checkers to dance around at runtime trying to
validate whether mutating the instance is allowed.

Finally, to actually build all this machinery up, the base is ``_SingletonMeta``, which is a
metaclass compatible with any metaclass of :class:`~.circuit.Instruction`.  This defines the
:meth:`~object.__call__` machinery that overrides :class:`type.__call__ <type>` to return the
singleton instances.  The other component of it is its :meth:`~object.__new__`, which is called
(non-trivially) during the creation of :class:`SingletonGate` and :class:`SingletonInstruction` with
its ``overrides`` keyword argument set to define the ``__init_subclass__`` of those classes with the
above properties.  We use the metaclass to add this method dynamically, because the
:meth:`~object.__init_subclass__` machinery wants to be abstract, closing over the ``overrides`` and
the base class, but still able to call :class:`super`.  It's more convenient to do this dynamically,
closing over the desired class variable and using the two-argument form of :class:`super`, since the
zero-argument form does magic introspection based on where its containing function was defined.

Handling multiple singletons requires storing the initialization arguments in some form, to allow
the :meth:`~.Instruction.to_mutable` method and pickling to be defined.  We do this as a lookup
dictionary on the singleton *type object*.  This is logically an instance attribute, but because we
need to dynamically switch in the dynamic `_Singleton` type onto an instance of the base type, that
gets rather complex; either we have to require that the base already has an instance dictionary, or we
risk breaking the ``__slots__`` layout during the switch.  Since the singletons have lifetimes that
last until garbage collection of their base class's type object, we can fake out this instance
dictionary using a type-object dictionary that maps instance pointers to the data we want to store.
An alternative would be to build a new type object for each individual singleton that closes over
(or stores) the initializer arguments, but type objects are quite heavy and the principle is largely
same anyway.

    attributes is not available and they can only be set at creation time, or on an object that has
    been specifically made mutable using :meth:`~.Instruction.to_mutable`. If any of these

    the same gate a new separate instance will be created."""
