class Operation(ABC):
    """Quantum operation interface.

    The minimal interface that any object must fulfil in order to be added to a
    :class:`.QuantumCircuit`.

    Concrete instances of this interface include :class:`~qiskit.circuit.Gate`,
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.Reset`, :class:`~qiskit.circuit.Barrier`,
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.Measure`, and operators such as :class:`~qiskit.quantum_info.Clifford`.

    The main purpose is to allow abstract mathematical objects to be added directly onto
    abstract circuits, and for the exact syntheses of these to be determined later, during
    compilation.

    Example:

        Add a Clifford and a Toffoli gate to a :class:`QuantumCircuit`.

        .. plot::
           :include-source:

           from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
           from qiskit.quantum_info import Clifford, random_clifford

           qc = QuantumCircuit(3)
           cliff = random_clifford(2)
