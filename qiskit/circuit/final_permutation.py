    Reasons about the implicit permutation of output qubits.

    The notation use here is the same as for the class :class:`~PermutationGate`:
    the permutation is stored as a list describing which qubits occupy the
    positions 0, 1, 2, etc. after applying the permutation. As an example,
    the permutation ``[2, 4, 3, 0, 1]`` means that the qubit ``2`` goes to
    position ``0``, qubit ``4`` goes to the position ``1``, and so on.
    In particular, a circuit with an implicit permutation :math:`\sigma`
    can be replaced by a :class:`~PermutationGate` with the same permutation
    pattern :math:`\sigma`.
