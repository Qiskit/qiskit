# unnormalized, but such that their matrix multiplication is still the identity.  This is because
# they are only used in unitary transformations (so it's safe to do so), and `sqrt(0.5)` is not
# exactly representable in floating point.  Doing it this way means that every element of the matrix
# is stored exactly correctly, and the multiplication is _exactly_ the identity rather than
# differing by 1ULP.
