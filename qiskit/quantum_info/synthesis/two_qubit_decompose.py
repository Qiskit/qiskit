"""
Expand 2-qubit Unitary operators into an equivalent
decomposition over SU(2)+fixed 2q basis gate, using the KAK method.

May be exact or approximate expansion. In either case uses the minimal
number of basis applications.

Method is described in Appendix B of Cross, A. W., Bishop, L. S., Sheldon, S., Nation, P. D. &
Gambetta, J. M. Validating quantum computers using randomized model circuits.
