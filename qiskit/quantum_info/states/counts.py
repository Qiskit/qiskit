    """Converts a statevector to counts
    of probabilities.

    This is useful, for example, when comparing
    output from the devices to the theoretically
    expected values using `plot_histogram` or
    the `hellinger_fidelity`.

    Parameters:
        vec (ndarray): Input statevector.
        eps (float): Optional tolerance.
        density_matrix_diag (bool): Input is a density matrix diagonal.

    Returns:
        dict: Counts of probabilities.

    Raises:
        QiskitError: Invalid input vector.

    Example:
        .. jupyter-execute::

           from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, execute
           from qiskit.quantum_info.states import state_to_counts
