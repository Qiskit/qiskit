class ListOp(OperatorBase):
    """
    Deprecated: A Class for manipulating List Operators, and parent class to ``SummedOp``,
    ``ComposedOp`` and ``TensoredOp``.

    List Operators are classes for storing and manipulating lists of Operators, State functions,
    or Measurements, and include some rule or ``combo_fn`` defining how the Operator functions
    of the list constituents should be combined to form to cumulative Operator function of the
    ``ListOp``. For example, a ``SummedOp`` has an addition-based ``combo_fn``, so once the
    Operators in its list are evaluated against some bitstring to produce a list of results,
    we know to add up those results to produce the final result of the ``SummedOp``'s
    evaluation. In theory, this ``combo_fn`` can be any function over classical complex values,
    but for convenience we've chosen for them to be defined over NumPy arrays and values. This way,
    large numbers of evaluations, such as after calling ``to_matrix`` on the list constituents,
    can be efficiently combined. While the combination function is defined over classical
    values, it should be understood as the operation by which each Operators' underlying
    function is combined to form the underlying Operator function of the ``ListOp``. In this
    way, the ``ListOps`` are the basis for constructing large and sophisticated Operators,
    State Functions, and Measurements.

    The base ``ListOp`` class is particularly interesting, as its ``combo_fn`` is "the identity
    list Operation". Meaning, if we understand the ``combo_fn`` as a function from a list of
    complex values to some output, one such function is returning the list as-is. This is
    powerful for constructing compact hierarchical Operators which return many measurements in
    multiple dimensional lists.
