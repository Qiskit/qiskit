    r"""Deprecated: Circuit to gradient operator converter.

    Converter for changing parameterized circuits into operators
    whose evaluation yields the gradient with respect to the circuit parameters.

    This is distinct from DerivativeBase converters which take gradients of composite
    operators and handle things like differentiating combo_fn's and enforcing product rules
    when operator coefficients are parameterized.

    CircuitGradient - uses quantum techniques to get derivatives of circuits
    DerivativeBase - uses classical techniques to differentiate operator flow data structures
