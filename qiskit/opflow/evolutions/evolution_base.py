class EvolutionBase(ConverterBase):
    r"""
    A base for Evolution converters.
    Evolutions are converters which traverse an Operator tree, replacing any ``EvolvedOp`` `e`
    with a Schrodinger equation-style evolution ``CircuitOp`` equalling or approximating the
    matrix exponential of -i * the Operator contained inside (`e.primitive`). The Evolutions are
    essentially implementations of Hamiltonian Simulation algorithms, including various methods
    for Trotterization.

             operator: The Operator to convert.

        Returns:
            The converted Operator, with ``EvolutionOps`` replaced by ``CircuitOps``.
