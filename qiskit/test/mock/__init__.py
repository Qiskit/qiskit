Utilities for mocking the IBMQ provider, including job responses and backends.

The module includes dummy provider, backends, and jobs.
The purpose of these classes is to fake backends for testing purposes:
testing local timeouts, arbitrary responses or behavior, etc.

The mock devices are mainly for testing the compiler.
