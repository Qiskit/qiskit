    """Replace qiskit.IBMQ with a mock that returns a single backend.

    Note this will set the value of qiskit.IBMQ to a MagicMock object. It is
    intended to be run as part of docstrings with jupyter-example in a hidden
    cell so that later examples which rely on ibmq devices so that the docs can
    be built without requiring configured credentials. If used outside of this
    context be aware that you will have to manually restore qiskit.IBMQ the
    value to qiskit.providers.ibmq.IBMQ after you finish using your mock.

    Args:
        backend (str): The class name as a string for the fake device to
            return from the mock IBMQ object. For example, FakeVigo.
