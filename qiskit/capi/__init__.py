================================================
C API interface from Python (:mod:`qiskit.capi`)
================================================

.. currentmodule:: qiskit.capi

This module provides Python-space interactions with Qiskit's public C API.

For documentation on the C API itself, see `Qiskit C API
<https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/docs/api/qiskit-c/>`__.

Build-system interaction
========================

The Python package :mod:`qiskit` contains all of the Qiskit C API header files, and a compiled
shared-object library that includes all of the C-API functions.  You can access the locations of
these two objects with the functions :func:`get_include` and :func:`get_lib` respectively.

.. warning::
    You typically *should not* link directly against the output of :func:`get_lib`, unless you know
    what you are doing.  In particular, directly linking against this object is not a safe way to
    build a distributable Python extension module that uses Qiskit's C API.

    However, if you understand all the caveats of direct linking, you can use the function to get
    the location of the library.

.. autofunction:: get_include
.. autofunction:: get_lib


Native bindings to the C API
============================

Additionally, this module contains :mod:`ctypes` bindings to all Qiskit C API types and functions.
These are avaialble as module attributes on :mod:`qiskit.capi` with the same name as they have in
the C API.  For example, ``qiskit.capi.qk_circuit_new`` corresponds to :c:func:`qk_circuit_new`.

.. py:attribute:: LIB
    :type: ctypes.PyDLL

    A :mod:`ctypes` wrapper around the library containing the Qiskit C API.

    This is provided for completeness, though you can access all the functions, structs and
    enumerations directly from the :mod:`qiskit.capi` module object.

Structs
-------

Concrete ``struct`` types used in the C API are declared as corresponding :class:`ctypes.Structure`
types with a complete :attr:`~ctypes.Structure._fields_` attribute.  These can be instantiated and
inspected directly.

Opaque pointers are represented by a :class:`ctypes.Structure` type with no
:attr:`~ctypes.Structure._fields_` attribute set, and cannot be instantiated.  They are typically
returned from functions wrapped in a :class:`ctypes.POINTER` type wrapper.

Enums
-----

In places where the C API has an enumeration, this module declares a Python :class:`enum.Enum` whose
values are a corresponding :mod:`ctypes` primitive integer type.  The Python-space
:class:`~enum.Enum` type object is still a wrapping Python object, so :mod:`ctypes` functions that
return an enumeration will return the raw numeric value, not the value in the :class:`~enum.Enum`.
The Python-space :class:`~enum.Enum` objects are declared for convenience in constructing calls.

Functions
---------

All the public library functions in the Qiskit C API are fully typed, and re-exported in the module
root with the same name as they have in C.  You can also access the functions from :attr:`LIB`, if
you prefer.

Note that header-only functions, such as :c:func:`qk_import`, are not exported because they are not
part of the C API library object.
