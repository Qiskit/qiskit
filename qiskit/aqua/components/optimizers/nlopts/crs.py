    Controlled Random Search (CRS) with local mutation optimizer.

    Controlled Random Search (CRS) with local mutation is part of the family of the CRS optimizers.
    The CRS optimizers start with a random population of points, and randomly evolve these points
    by heuristic rules. In the case of CRS with local mutation, the evolution is a randomized
    version of the :class:`NELDER_MEAD` local optimizer.
