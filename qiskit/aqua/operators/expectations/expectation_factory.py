        A factory method for convenient automatic selection of an Expectation based on the
        Operator to be converted and backend used to sample the expectation value.

        Args:
            operator: The Operator whose expectation value will be taken.
            backend: The backend which will be used to sample the expectation value.
            include_custom: Whether the factory will include the (Aer) specific custom
                expectations if their behavior against the backend might not be as expected.
                For instance when using Aer qasm_simulator with paulis the Aer snapshot can
                be used but the outcome lacks shot noise and hence does not intuitively behave
                overall as people might expect when choosing a qasm_simulator. It is however
                fast as long as the more state vector like behavior is acceptable.

        Returns:
            The expectation algorithm which best fits the Operator and backend.

        Raises:
            ValueError: If operator is not of a composition for which we know the best Expectation
                method.
