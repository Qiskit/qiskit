Python interface to the Rust lowering pass manager objects.

Much of the actual driver logic here is defined in the Rust ``qiskit_pyext::passmanager`` module,
but that's the very low-level private interface.  This module provides the Python-friendly
higher-order wrapper logic around that low-level interface.
