class PropertySet(dict):
    """A default dictionary-like that works as a shared memory among transpilation passes.

    A single instance is created when a pass manager starts running and is handed from pass to
    pass, so they can use it to communicate: a pass reads what earlier passes recorded and writes
    in place what later passes might need.  It lives only for the duration of the run.

    Keys are free-form, so a pass should document whatever it reads and writes.  The transpiler
    relies on some by convention, such as ``"layout"`` and ``"original_qubit_indices"`` from the
    layout stage, ``"final_layout"`` from routing, and ``"node_start_time"`` from scheduling
    analysis; see :ref:`transpiler-preset-stage-layout` and
    :ref:`transpiler-preset-stage-scheduling`.

    Unlike :class:`dict`, looking up a missing key returns ``None`` rather than raising
    :exc:`KeyError`, so a pass can test for a property it may be the first to set::
