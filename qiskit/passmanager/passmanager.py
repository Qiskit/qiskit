                function will be called with 4 keyword arguments::

                    count (int): the index for the pass execution

                The exact arguments pass expose the internals of the pass
                manager and are subject to change as the pass manager internals
                change. If you intend to reuse a callback function over
                multiple releases be sure to check that the arguments being
                passed are the same.

                To use the callback feature you define a function that will
                take in kwargs dict and access the variables. For example::

                    def callback_func(**kwargs):
                        task = kwargs['task']
                        passmanager_ir = kwargs['passmanager_ir']

                        ...
