Qiskit API documentation
########################

Qiskit is an open-source framework for working with quantum computers
at the level of circuits, pulses, and algorithms.

A central goal of Qiskit is to build a software stack
that makes it easy for anyone to use quantum computers. However, Qiskit also aims
to facilitate research on the most important open issues facing quantum computation today.

You can use Qiskit to easily design experiments and run them on simulators and real
quantum computers.

Qiskit consists of four foundational elements:

- :ref:`Qiskit Terra <Terra>`: Composing quantum programs at the level of circuits
  and pulses with the code foundation.

- :ref:`Qiskit Aer <Aer>`: Accelerating development via simulators and noise
  models

- :ref:`Qiskit Ignis <Ignis>`: Addressing noise and errors

- :ref:`Qiskit Aqua <Aqua>`: Building algorithms and applications
