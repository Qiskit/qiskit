Installation
============

Let's get started using Qiskit!  The first thing to do is choose how you're
going to run and install the packages.  There are three main ways to do this:

.. tab-set::

    .. tab-item:: Start locally

        Qiskit supports Python 3.7 or later. However, both Python and Qiskit are
        evolving ecosystems, and sometimes when new releases occur in one or the other,
        there can be problems with compatibility.

        You will need to `download Python <https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download>`__
        on your local system to get started. `Jupyter <https://jupyter.org/install>`__ is recommended for
        interacting with Qiskit.

        We recommend using `Python virtual environments <https://docs.python.org/3.10/tutorial/venv.html>`__
        to cleanly separate Qiskit from other applications and improve your experience.

        Create a minimal environment with only Python installed in it.

        .. code:: text

            python3 -m venv /path/to/virtual/environment

        Activate your new environment.

        .. code:: text

            source /path/to/virtual/environment/bin/activate


        Note: if you are using Windows, use the following commands in PowerShell.

        .. code:: text

           python3 -m venv c:\path\to\virtual\environment
           c:\path\to\virtual\environment\Scripts\Activate.ps1


        Next, install the Qiskit package.

        .. code:: text

            pip install qiskit

        If the packages were installed correctly, you can run ``pip list`` to see the active
        packages in your virtual environment.

        If you intend to use visualization functionality or Jupyter notebooks it is
        recommended to install Qiskit with the extra ``visualization`` support:

        .. code:: text

            pip install qiskit[visualization]

        It is worth pointing out that if you're a zsh user (which is the default shell on newer
        versions of macOS), you'll need to put ``qiskit[visualization]`` in quotes:

        .. code:: text

            pip install 'qiskit[visualization]'

    .. tab-item:: Start on the cloud

        The following cloud vendors have Qiskit pre-installed in their environments:

          <div class="pagination d-flex justify-content-center"></div>
          </div>
          </div>
          </div>

    .. tab-item:: Install from source

       Installing the elements from source allows you to access the most recently
       updated version of Qiskit instead of using the version in the Python Package
       Index (PyPI) repository. This will give you the ability to inspect and extend
       the latest version of the Qiskit code more efficiently.

       When installing the elements and components from source, by default their
       ``development`` version (which corresponds to the ``master`` git branch) will
       be used, as opposed to the ``stable`` version (which contains the same codebase
       as the published ``pip`` packages). Since the ``development`` versions of an
       element or component usually include new features and changes, they generally
       require using the ``development`` version of the rest of the items as well.

       Installing elements from source requires the following order of installation to
       prevent installing versions of elements that may be lower than those desired if the
       ``pip`` version is behind the source versions:

       #. :ref:`qiskit-terra <install-qiskit-terra>`
       #. :ref:`qiskit-aer <install-qiskit-aer>`

       To work with several components and elements simultaneously, use the following
       steps for each element.

       .. note::

          The Terra and Aer packages both require a compiler to build from source before
          you can install. Ignis, Aqua, and the IBM Quantum Provider backend
          do not require a compiler.

       .. note::

          Due to the use of namespace packaging in Python, care must be taken in how you
          install packages. If you're planning to install any element from source, do not
          use the ``qiskit`` meta-package. Also, follow this guide and use a separate virtual
          environment for development. If you do choose to mix an existing installation
          with your development, refer to
          https://github.com/pypa/sample-namespace-packages/blob/master/table.md
          for the set of combinations of installation methods that work together.

       .. raw:: html

          <h3>Set up the Virtual Development Environment</h3>

       .. code-block:: text

          python3 -m venv QiskitDevenv
          source QiskitDevenv/bin/activate

       .. _install-qiskit-terra:

       .. raw:: html

          <h2>Installing Terra from Source</h2>

       Installing from source requires that you have the Rust compiler on your system.
       To install the Rust compiler the recommended path is to use rustup, which is
       a cross-platform Rust installer. To use rustup you can go to:

       https://rustup.rs/

       which will provide instructions for how to install rust on your platform.
       Besides rustup there are
       `other installation methods <https://forge.rust-lang.org/infra/other-installation-methods.html>`__ available too.

       Once the Rust compiler is installed, you are ready to install Qiskit Terra.

       1. Clone the Terra repository.

          .. code:: text

             git clone https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra.git

       2. Cloning the repository creates a local folder called ``qiskit-terra``.

          .. code:: text

             cd qiskit-terra

       3. If you want to run tests or linting checks, install the developer requirements.

          .. code:: text

             pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

       4. Install ``qiskit-terra``.

          .. code:: text

             pip install .

       If you want to install it in editable mode, meaning that code changes to the
       project don't require a reinstall to be applied, you can do this with:

       .. code:: text

          pip install -e .

       Installing in editable mode will build the compiled extensions in debug mode
       without optimizations. This will affect the runtime performance of the compiled
       code. If you'd like to use editable mode and build the compiled code in release
       with optimizations enabled you can run:

       .. code:: text

           python setup.py build_rust --release --inplace

       after you run pip and that will rebuild the binary in release mode.
       If you are working on Rust code in Qiskit you will need to rebuild the extension
       code every time you make a local change. ``pip install -e .`` will only build
       the Rust extension when it's called, so any local changes you make to the Rust
       code after running pip will not be reflected in the installed package unless
       you rebuild the extension. You can leverage the above ``build_rust`` command to
       do this (with or without ``--release`` based on whether you want to build in
       debug mode or release mode).

       You can then run the code examples after installing Terra. You can
       run the example with the following command.

       .. code:: text

          python examples/python/using_qiskit_terra_level_0.py



       .. _install-qiskit-aer:

       .. raw:: html

          <h2>Installing Aer from Source</h2>

       1. Clone the Aer repository.

          .. code:: text

             git clone https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer

       To install Aer depend on which operating system you are using. Since Aer is
       a compiled C++ program with a Python interface, there are non-Python
       dependencies for building the Aer binary which can't be installed universally
       depending on operating system.

       .. dropdown:: Linux

          2. Install compiler requirements.

             Building Aer requires a C++ compiler and development headers.

             If you're using Fedora or an equivalent Linux distribution,
             install using:

             .. code:: text

                   dnf install @development-tools

             For Ubuntu/Debian install it using:

             .. code:: text

                   apt-get install build-essential

          3. Install OpenBLAS development headers.

             If you're using Fedora or an equivalent Linux distribution,
             install using:

             .. code:: text

                   dnf install openblas-devel

             For Ubuntu/Debian install it using:

             .. code:: text

                   apt-get install libopenblas-dev


       .. dropdown:: macOS

          2. Install dependencies.

             To use the `Clang <https://clang.llvm.org/>`__ compiler on macOS, you need to install
             an extra library for supporting `OpenMP <https://www.openmp.org/>`__.  You can use `brew <https://brew.sh/>`__
             to install this and other dependencies.

             .. code:: text

                   brew install libomp

          3. Then install a BLAS implementation; `OpenBLAS <https://www.openblas.net/>`__
             is the default choice.

             .. code:: text

                   brew install openblas

             Next, install ``Xcode Command Line Tools``.

             .. code:: text

                   xcode-select --install

       .. dropdown:: Windows

          2. All dependencies are added as part of the Visual C++ compiler installed above,
             so no additional setup is needed.


       Qiskit Aer is a high performance simulator framework for quantum circuits. It
       provides `several backends <apidoc/aer_provider.html#simulator-backends>`__
       to achieve different simulation goals.


       4. Build and install qiskit-aer directly

          If you have pip <19.0.0 installed and your environment doesn't require a
          custom build, run:

          .. code:: text

             cd qiskit-aer
             pip install .

          This will both build the binaries and install Aer.

          Alternatively, if you have a newer pip installed, or have some custom requirement,
          you can build a Python wheel manually.

          .. code:: text

             cd qiskit-aer
             python ./setup.py bdist_wheel

          If you need to set a custom option during the wheel build, refer to
          :ref:`Custom options <aer_wheel_build_options>`.

          After you build the Python wheel, it will be stored in the ``dist/`` dir in the
          Aer repository. The exact version will depend

          .. code:: text

             cd dist
             pip install qiskit_aer-*.whl

          The exact filename of the output wheel file depends on the current version of
          Aer under development.

       .. _aer_wheel_build_options:

       .. raw:: html

          <h4>Custom options</h4>

       The Aer build system uses `scikit-build <https://scikit-build.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`__
       to run the compilation when building it with the Python interface. It acts as an interface for
       `setuptools <https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__ to call `CMake <https://cmake.org/>`__
       and compile the binaries for your local system.

       Due to the complexity of compiling the binaries, you may need to pass options
       to a certain part of the build process. The way to pass variables is:

       .. code:: text

          python setup.py bdist_wheel [skbuild_opts] [-- [cmake_opts] [-- build_tool_opts]]

       where the elements within square brackets `[]` are optional, and
       ``skbuild_opts``, ``cmake_opts``, ``build_tool_opts`` are to be replaced by
       flags of your choice. A list of *CMake* options is available here:
       https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.6/manual/cmake.1.html#options. For
       example, you could run something like:

       .. code:: text

          python setup.py bdist_wheel -- -- -j8

       This is passing the flag `-j8` to the underlying build system (which in this
       case is `Automake <https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/>`__), telling it that you want
       to build in parallel using 8 processes.

       For example, a common use case for these flags on linux is to specify a
       specific version of the C++ compiler to use (normally if the default is too
       old):

       .. code:: text

          python setup.py bdist_wheel -- -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++-7

       which will tell CMake to use the g++-7 command instead of the default g++ when
       compiling Aer.

       Another common use case for this, depending on your environment, is that you may
       need to specify your platform name and turn off static linking.

       .. code:: text

          python setup.py bdist_wheel --plat-name macosx-10.9-x86_64 \
          -- -DSTATIC_LINKING=False -- -j8

       Here ``--plat-name`` is a flag to setuptools, to specify the platform name to
       use in the package metadata, ``-DSTATIC_LINKING`` is a flag for using CMake
       to disable static linking, and ``-j8`` is a flag for using Automake to use
       8 processes for compilation.

       A list of common options depending on platform are:

       +--------+------------+----------------------+---------------------------------------------+
       |Platform| Tool       | Option               | Use Case                                    |
       +========+============+======================+=============================================+
       | All    | Automake   | -j                   | Followed by a number, sets the number of    |
       |        |            |                      | processes to use for compilation.           |
       +--------+------------+----------------------+---------------------------------------------+
       | Linux  | CMake      | -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER | Used to specify a specific C++ compiler;    |
       |        |            |                      | this is often needed if your default g++ is |
       |        |            |                      | too old.                                    |
       +--------+------------+----------------------+---------------------------------------------+
       | OSX    | setuptools | --plat-name          | Used to specify the platform name in the    |
       |        |            |                      | output Python package.                      |
       +--------+------------+----------------------+---------------------------------------------+
       | OSX    | CMake      | -DSTATIC_LINKING     | Used to specify whether or not              |
       |        |            |                      | static linking should be used.              |
       +--------+------------+----------------------+---------------------------------------------+

       .. note::
          Some of these options are not platform-specific. These particular platforms are listed
          because they are commonly used in the environment. Refer to the
          tool documentation for more information.

.. _platform_support:

Platform Support
----------------

Qiskit strives to support as many platforms as possible, but due to limitations
in available testing resources and platform availability, not all platforms
can be supported. Platform support for Qiskit is broken into 3 tiers with different
levels of support for each tier. For platforms outside these, Qiskit is probably
still installable, but it's not tested and you will have to build Qiskit (and likely
Qiskit's dependencies) from source.

Additionally, Qiskit only supports CPython. Running with other Python
interpreters isn't currently supported.

Tier 1
''''''

Tier 1 supported platforms are fully tested upstream as part of the development
processes to ensure any proposed change will function correctly. Pre-compiled
binaries are built, tested, and published to PyPI as part of the release process.
These platforms are expected to be installable with just a functioning Python
environment as all dependencies are available on these platforms.

Tier 1 platforms are currently:

 * Linux x86_64 (distributions compatible with the
   `manylinux 2014 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0599/>`__
   packaging specification.
 * macOS x86_64 (10.9 or newer)
 * Windows 64 bit

Tier 2
''''''

Tier 2 platforms are not tested upstream as part of development process. However,
pre-compiled binaries are built, tested, and published to PyPI as part of the
release process and these packages can be expected to be installed with just a
functioning Python environment.

Tier 2 platforms are currently:

 * Linux i686 (distributions compatible with the
   `manylinux 2014 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0599/>`__ packaging
   specification) for Python < 3.10
 * Windows 32 bit for Python < 3.10
 * Linux aarch64 (distributions compatible with the
   `manylinux 2014 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0599/>`__ packaging
   specification)

Tier 3
''''''

Tier 3 platforms are not tested upstream as part of the development process.  Pre-compiled
binaries are built and published to PyPI as part of the release process, with no
testing at all. They may not be installable with just a functioning Python
environment and may require a C/C++ compiler or additional programs to build
dependencies from source as part of the installation process. Support for these
platforms are best effort only.

Tier 3 platforms are currently:

 * Linux ppc64le (distributions compatible with the
   `manylinux 2014 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0599/>`__ packaging
   specification)
 * Linux s390x (distributions compatible with the
   `manylinux 2014 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0599/>`__ packaging
   specification)
 * macOS arm64 (10.15 or newer)
 * Linux i686 (distributions compatible with the
   `manylinux 2014 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0599/>`__ packaging
   specification) for Python >= 3.10
 * Windows 32 bit for Python >= 3.10
