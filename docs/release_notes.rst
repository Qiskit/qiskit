..
    These release notes get converted into Markdown files via the infrastructure at https://github.com/Qiskit/documentation, which then gets deployed to https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit/release-notes. Changes to these release notes will update those release notes the next time the API docs are generated.

    To change release notes prior to Qiskit 0.45, update the Qiskit/documentation repository directly.
