Qiskit |version| release notes
==============================

..
    These release notes get converted into Markdown files via the infrastructure at
    https://github.com/Qiskit/documentation, which then gets deployed to
    https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/docs/api/qiskit/release-notes. Changes to these release notes will
    update those release notes the next time the API docs are generated for this version.

    You should set `earliest-version` to:

    * if on a `stable` branch, then the _earliest_ tagged release of the minor series.  For
      `stable/2.1` this would be `2.1.0rc1`.  For `stable/2.2` this would be `2.2.0b1`.  Typically
      you should update this as part of making the `x.y.0` "final" release (e.g. when tagging
      `2.2.0` or `2.3.0`).
    * if on `main`: it doesn't matter all too much; it just affects how many old release notes
      are built and tested as part of the release.  It still needs to be a tag reachable on `main`,
      though, which is typically `rc1` tags.
