Qiskit |version| release notes
==============================

..
    These release notes get converted into Markdown files via the infrastructure at https://github.com/Qiskit/documentation, which then gets deployed to https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit/release-notes. Changes to these release notes will update those release notes the next time the API docs are generated for this version.

    `:earliest-version:` should be set to the rc1 release for the current minor release series. For example, the stable/1.1 branch should set it to 1.1.0rc1. If on `main`, set to the prior minor version's rc1, like `1.0.0rc1`.
