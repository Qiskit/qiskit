Introduction to Qiskit
======================

When using Qiskit a user workflow nominally consists of
following four high-level steps:

- **Build**: Design a quantum circuit(s) that represents the problem you are
  considering.
- **Compile**: Compile circuits for a specific quantum service, e.g. a quantum
  system or classical simulator.
- **Run**: Run the compiled circuits on the specified quantum service(s).  These
  services can be cloud-based or local.
- **Analyze**: Compute summary statistics and visualize the results of the
  experiments.

Here is an example of the entire workflow, with each step explained in detail in
subsequent sections:

.. plot::
    :include-source:
    :context:

    from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, transpile
    from qiskit_aer import AerSimulator
    from qiskit.visualization import plot_histogram

    # Use Aer's AerSimulator
    simulator = AerSimulator()

    # Create a Quantum Circuit acting on the q register
    circuit = QuantumCircuit(2, 2)

    # Add a H gate on qubit 0
    circuit.h(0)

    # Add a CX (CNOT) gate on control qubit 0 and target qubit 1
    circuit.cx(0, 1)

    # Map the quantum measurement to the classical bits
    circuit.measure([0, 1], [0, 1])

    # Compile the circuit for the support instruction set (basis_gates)
    # and topology (coupling_map) of the backend
    compiled_circuit = transpile(circuit, simulator)

    # Execute the circuit on the aer simulator
    job = simulator.run(compiled_circuit, shots=1000)

    # Grab results from the job
    result = job.result()

    # Returns counts
    counts = result.get_counts(compiled_circuit)
    print("\nTotal count for 00 and 11 are:", counts)

    # Draw the circuit
    circuit.draw("mpl")

.. plot::
    :include-source:
    :context: close-figs

    # Plot a histogram
    plot_histogram(counts)



-----------------------
Workflow Step--by--Step
-----------------------

The program above can be broken down into six steps:

1. Import packages
2. Initialize variables
3. Add gates
4. Visualize the circuit
5. Simulate the experiment
6. Visualize the results


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Step 1 : Import Packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The basic elements needed for your program are imported as follows:

.. code-block:: python

  from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
  from qiskit_aer import AerSimulator
  from qiskit.visualization import plot_histogram

In more detail, the imports are

- ``QuantumCircuit``: can be thought as the instructions of the quantum system.
  It holds all your quantum operations.
- ``AerSimulator``: is the Aer high performance circuit simulator.
- ``plot_histogram``: creates histograms.



~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Step 2 : Initialize Variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Consider the next line of code

.. code-block:: python

    circuit = QuantumCircuit(2, 2)

Here, you are initializing with 2 qubits in the zero state; with 2
classical bits set to zero; and ``circuit`` is the quantum circuit.

Syntax:

- ``QuantumCircuit(int, int)``



~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Step 3 : Add Gates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can add gates (operations) to manipulate the registers of your circuit.

Consider the following three lines of code:

.. code-block:: python

    circuit.h(0)
    circuit.cx(0, 1)
    circuit.measure([0, 1], [0, 1])

The gates are added to the circuit one-by-one to form the Bell state

.. math:: \lvert\psi\rangle = \left(\lvert00\rangle+\lvert11\rangle\right)/\sqrt{2}.

The code above applies the following gates:

- ``QuantumCircuit.h(0)``: A Hadamard gate :math:`H` on qubit 0,
  which puts it into a **superposition state**.
- ``QuantumCircuit.cx(0, 1)``: A controlled-Not operation
  (:math:`CNOT`) on control qubit 0 and target qubit 1, putting the qubits in
  an **entangled state**.
- ``QuantumCircuit.measure([0,1], [0,1])``: if you pass
  the entire quantum and classical registers to ``measure``, the ith qubitâ€™s
  measurement result will be stored in the ith classical bit.



~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Step 4 : Visualize the Circuit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use :meth:`qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.draw` to view the circuit that you have designed
in the various forms used in many textbooks and research articles.

.. plot::
    :include-source:
    :context: close-figs

    circuit.draw("mpl")

In this circuit, the qubits are ordered with qubit zero at the top and
qubit one at the bottom. The circuit is read left-to-right, meaning that gates
which are applied earlier in the circuit show up farther to the left.

The default backend for ``QuantumCircuit.draw()`` or ``qiskit.visualization.circuit_drawer()``
is the text backend. However, depending on your local environment you may want to change
these defaults to something better suited for your use case. This is done with the user
config file.  By default the user config file should be located in
``~/.qiskit/settings.conf`` and is a ``.ini`` file.

For example, a ``settings.conf`` file for setting a Matplotlib drawer is:

.. code-block:: text

  [default]
  circuit_drawer = mpl

You can use any of the valid circuit drawer backends as the value for this config, this includes
text, mpl, latex, and latex_source.



~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Step 5 : Simulate the Experiment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Qiskit Aer <https://qiskit.org/ecosystem/aer>`_ is a high performance
simulator framework for quantum circuits. It provides several backends to
achieve different simulation goals.

If you have issues installing Aer, you can alternatively use the Basic Aer
provider by replacing `Aer` with `BasicAer`. Basic Aer is included in Qiskit.

.. code-block:: python

    from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, transpile
    from qiskit.providers.basicaer import QasmSimulatorPy
    ...

To simulate this circuit, you will use the ``AerSimulator``. Each run of this
circuit will yield either the bit string 00 or 11.

.. plot::
    :include-source:
    :context: close-figs

    simulator = AerSimulator()
    compiled_circuit = transpile(circuit, simulator)
    job = simulator.run(compiled_circuit, shots=1000)
    result = job.result()
    counts = result.get_counts(circuit)
    print("\nTotal count for 00 and 11 are:",counts)

As expected, the output bit string is 00 approximately 50 percent of the time.
The number of times the circuit is run can be specified via the ``shots``
argument of the ``execute`` method. The number of shots of the simulation was
set to be 1000 (the default is 1024).

Once you have a ``result`` object, you can access the counts via the method
``get_counts(circuit)``. This gives you the aggregate outcomes of the
experiment you ran.



~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Step 6 : Visualize the Results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Qiskit provides `many visualizations <apidoc/visualization.html>`__,

including the function ``plot_histogram``, to view your results.

.. plot::
  :include-source:
  :context: close-figs

  plot_histogram(counts)

The observed probabilities :math:`Pr(00)` and :math:`Pr(11)` are computed by
taking the respective counts and dividing by the total number of shots.

.. note::

  Try changing the ``shots`` keyword in the ``run()`` method to see how
  the estimated probabilities change.
