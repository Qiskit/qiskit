  prelude: >
      Replace this text with content to appear at the top of the section for this
      release. All of the prelude content is merged together and then rendered
      separately from the items listed in other parts of the file, so the text
      needs to be worded so that both the prelude and the other items make sense
      when read independently. This may mean repeating some details. Not every
      release note requires a prelude. Usually only notes describing major
      features or adding release theme details should have a prelude.
  features:
    - |
      List new features here, or remove this section.  All of the list items in
      this section are combined when the release notes are rendered, so the text
      needs to be worded so that it does not depend on any information only
      available in another section, such as the prelude. This may mean repeating
      some details. If the feature note is contained within one of the modules
      listed below you should use the appropriate subsection instead.
  features_circuits:
    - |
      New features related to the qiskit.circuit module.
  features_primitives:
    - |
      New features related to the qiskit.primitives module.
  features_providers:
    - |
      New features related to the qiskit.providers module.
  features_pulse:
    - |
      New features related to the qiskit.pulse module.
  features_qasm:
    - |
      New features related to the qiskit.qasm2 or qiskit.qasm3 modules.
  features_qpy:
    - |
      New features related to the qiskit.qpy module.
  features_quantum_info:
    - |
      New features related to the qiskit.quantum_info module.
  features_synthesis:
    - |
      New features related to the qiskit.synthesis module.
  features_transpiler:
    - |
      New features related to the qiskit.transpiler and qiskit.dagcircuit
      modules.
  features_visualization:
    - |
      New features related to the qiskit.visualization module.
  features_misc:
    - |
      New miscellaneous features.
  issues:
    - |
      List known issues here, or remove this section.  All of the list items in
      this section are combined when the release notes are rendered, so the text
      needs to be worded so that it does not depend on any information only
      available in another section, such as the prelude. This may mean repeating
      some details.
  upgrade:
    - |
      List upgrade notes here, or remove this section.  All of the list items in
      this section are combined when the release notes are rendered, so the text
      needs to be worded so that it does not depend on any information only
      available in another section, such as the prelude. This may mean repeating
      some details. If the upgrade note is contained within one of the modules
      listed below you should use the appropriate subsection instead.
  upgrade_circuits:
    - |
      Notes with upgrade impact related to the qiskit.circuit module.
  upgrade_primitives:
    - |
      Notes with upgrade impact related to the qiskit.primitives module.
