    The method :meth:`qiskit.result.marginal_counts`, when passed a :class:`.Result` from a
    pulse backend, would fail, because it contains an array of
    ExperimentResult objects, each of which have an QobjExperimentHeader, and those
    ExperimentHeaders lack "creg_sizes" instance-variables.  If the Result came
    from an simulator backend (e.g. Aer), that instance-variable would be there.
    We fix marginal_counts() so that it skips logic that needs creg_sizes if the
    field is not present, or non-None.
