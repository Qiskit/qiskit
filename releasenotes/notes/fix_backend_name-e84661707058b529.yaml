    Fixed an issue in the :class:`.QuantumInstance` class where it was assuming
    all ``AerSimulator`` backends were always :class:`.BackendV1`. This would cause
    combatibility issues with the 0.13.0 release of ``qiskit-aer`` which is starting to
    use :class:`.BackendV2` for `AerSimulator`` backends.
