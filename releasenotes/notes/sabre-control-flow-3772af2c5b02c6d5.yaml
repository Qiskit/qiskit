    Control-flow operations are now supported by the Sabre family
    of transpiler passes, namely layout pass :class:`.SabreLayout`
    and routing pass :class:`.SabreSwap`. Function :func:`.transpile`
    keyword arguments ``layout_method`` and ``routing_method`` now
    accept the option "sabre" for circuits with control flow,
    which was previously unsupported.
