    The mock backends in ``qiskit.test.mock`` now have a functional ``run()``
    method that will return results similar to the real devices. If qiskit-aer
    is installed a simulation will be run with a noise model built from the
    device snapshot in the fake backend.  Otherwise,
    :class:`qiskit.basicaer.QasmSimulatorPy` will be used to run an ideal
    simulation. Additionally, if a pulse experiment is passed to ``run`` and
    qiskit-aer is installed the PulseSimulator will be used to simulate the
    pulse schedules.
