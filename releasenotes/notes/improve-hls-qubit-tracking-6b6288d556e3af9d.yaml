    Improved handling of ancilla qubits in the :class:`.HighLevelSynthesis`
    transpiler pass. For example, a circuit may have custom gates whose
    definitions include :class:`.MCXGate`\s. Now the synthesis algorithms
    for the inner MCX-gates can use the ancilla qubits available on the
    global circuit but outside the custom gates' definitions.
