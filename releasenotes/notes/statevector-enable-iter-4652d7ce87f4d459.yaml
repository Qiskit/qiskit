    :class:`.Statevector` will now allow direct iteration through its values
    (such as ``for coefficient in statevector``) and
    correctly report its length under ``len``.  Previously it would try and
    and access out-of-bounds data and raise a :class:`.QiskitError`.  See
    `#8039 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/8039>`__.
