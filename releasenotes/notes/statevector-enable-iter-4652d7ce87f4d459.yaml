    :func:`~qiskit.quantum_info.states.Statevector.__iter__` and 
    :func:`~qiskit.quantum_info.states.Statevector.__len__` have been 
    added to facilitate iteration over and referencing the length of 
    a state vector, correspondingly.

    :class:`~qiskit.quantum_info.states.Statevector` objects raised an 
    ``qiskit.exceptions.QiskitError`` upon being iterated over, in 
    certain circumstances, due to the fact that no explicit iteration 
    mechanism had been implemented, as it hadn't been within the original 
    design scope. Instead, Python, as a fallback, relied in an ad-hoc manner on 
    :func:`~qiskit.quantum_info.states.Statevector.__getitem__` to provide 
    iteration functionality. If a key, that is being iterated over in such 
    manner, gets referenced and its value is outside of the range of values, 
    corresponding to valid ``dim`` dimensionality, then an error of 
    the aforementioned type occurred. Refer to 
    `#8039 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/8039>` for more
    details.
    This issue has been addressed by introducing 
    :func:`~qiskit.quantum_info.states.Statevector.__iter__`, which enables 
    correct behavior.
