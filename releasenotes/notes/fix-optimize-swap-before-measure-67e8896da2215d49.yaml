    Fixed an issue with the :class:`~.OptimizeSwapBeforeMeasure` pass where
    it would incorrectly optimize circuits involving swap and measure 
    instructions. This commit fixes the bug by changing `DAGCircuit.successors`
    to `DAGCircuit.descendants`. Also, added a couple of extra tests to ensure 
    that the bug is fixed. For example::

        from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
        from qiskit.transpiler.passes import OptimizeSwapBeforeMeasure
        pass_ = OptimizeSwapBeforeMeasure()
        qc = QuantumCircuit(2, 1)
        qc.swap(0, 1)
        qc.measure(0, 0)
        qc.measure(0, 0)
        print(qc.draw())
        print(pass_(qc).draw())
    
    would previously print::

                  ┌─┐┌─┐
          q_0: ─X─┤M├┤M├
                │ └╥┘└╥┘
          q_1: ─X──╫──╫─
                   ║  ║
          c: 1/════╩══╩═
                   0  0
               ┌─┐
          q_0: ┤M├───
               └╥┘┌─┐
          q_1: ─╫─┤M├
                ║ └╥┘
          c: 1/═╩══╩═
                0  0
    
    and now the second ciruit is correctly optimized to::
      
          q_0: ──────
               ┌─┐┌─┐
          q_1: ┤M├┤M├
               └╥┘└╥┘
          c: 1/═╩══╩═
                0  0
