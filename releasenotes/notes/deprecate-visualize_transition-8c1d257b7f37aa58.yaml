deprecations_visualization:
  - |
    The :func:`.transition_visualization` function has been deprecated and will
    be removed in the 2.0.0 release. This function had a number of limitations
    which limited it's utility to only very specific use cases and didn't fit in with
    the rest of the Qiskit visualization module.
