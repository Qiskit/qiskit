    The ``scoped_parameters`` and ``search_parameters`` methods have been
    removed from the `.ScheduleBlock` class. These methods returned
    `.Parameter` objects that partially linked to the parameters in the
    `.ScheduleBlock` instance but assigning values using these objects did not
    work correctly. Users should use `.ScheduleBlock.parameters` instead and
    iterate through `.ScheduleBlock.references` and compare to the
    `.Schedule.parameters` attributes of the subreferences when needing to
    distinguish which subroutine a parameter is used in. See `#11654
    https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/11654`__ for more information.
