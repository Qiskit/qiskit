    The ``backend_props`` argument of the
    :func:`.generate_translation_pass_manager` function is deprecated and
    will be removed in Qiskit 2.0. This argument is optional and is superseded
    if the required ``target`` argument is populated. As the
    :class:`.BackendProperties` is deprecated and will be removed in Qiskit
    2.0 specifying this option will also no longer work. Usage of the argument
    can safely be removed in 1.x as long as you were passing in a target.
