    The :class:`Operator` class now has ``.draw()`` methods allowing it to be displayed as 
    a text matrix, IPython Latex object or Latex source. The default draw type still is the 
    ASCII `__repr__` of the operator.

            from qiskit.quantum_info import Operator
            op = Operator.from_label('XH')
            op.draw('latex')
