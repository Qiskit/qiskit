    The minimum supported Rust version (MSRV) has been increased from 1.56.1
    to 1.61.0. If you're are building Qiskit from source you will now need to
    ensure that you have at least Rust 1.61.0 installed to be able to build
    Qiskit. This change was made as our upstream dependencies have increased
    their MSRVs.
