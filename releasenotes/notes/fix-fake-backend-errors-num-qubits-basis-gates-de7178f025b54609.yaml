    Fixes an issue where fake backends could run circuits
    with gates not in basis gates, or circuits with more
    qubits than available on the corresponding real device.
    Attempting to do so now raises appropriate errors.
    Refer to `#8509 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/8509>`
    for more details.
