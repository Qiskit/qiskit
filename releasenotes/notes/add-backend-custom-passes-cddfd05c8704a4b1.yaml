    The :class:`~.BackendV2` class now has support for two new optional hook
    points enabling backends to inject custom compilation steps as part of
    :func:`~.transpile` and :func:`~.generate_preset_pass_manager`. If a
    :class:`~.BackendV2` implementation includes the methods
    ``get_scheduling_stage()`` or ``get_post_translation_stage()`` the
    transpiler will use the returned :class:`~.PassManager` object to run
    additional custom transpiler passes when targetting that backend.
    For more details on how to use this see :ref:`custom_transpiler_backend`.
