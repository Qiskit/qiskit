    Added a new optional argument, ``reps`` to 
    :meth:`~qiskit.QuantumCircuit.decompose`, which allows to
    repeatedly decompose the circuit. For example::

        from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
        
        circuit = QuantumCircuit(1)
        circuit.ry(0.5, 0)
        
        # decompose 2 times
        circuit.decompose(reps=2)

        # decompose 2 times, but only RY and R gates
        circuit.decompose(gates_to_decompose=['ry','r'], reps=2)
