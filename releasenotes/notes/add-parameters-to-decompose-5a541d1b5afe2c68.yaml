    Added a new parameter, ``reps`` decomposem, will raise an error when ``gates_to_decompose`` appear with more than or less than 1``reps``

    Example
    .. code:: python

      #decompose ry 3 times, decompose initialize 2 times
      qc.decompose(gates_to_decompose=['ry'], reps=3).decompose(gates_to_decompose=['initialize'], reps=2)
