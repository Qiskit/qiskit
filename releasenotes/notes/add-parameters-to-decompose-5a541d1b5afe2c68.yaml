    Added a new parameter, ``reps`` decomposem, it also support decompose specific gate specific times

    Example
    .. code:: python

      #decompose ry 3 times, decompose initialize 2 times
      qc.decompose(gates_to_decompose=['ry'], reps=3).decompose(gates_to_decompose=['initialize'], reps=2)
