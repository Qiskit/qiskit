    New transpiler passes, 
    :class:`qiskit.transpiler.passes.optimization.normalize_rx_angle.NormalizeRXAngle`
    and
    :class:`qiskit.transpiler.passes.calibration.rx_builder.RXCalibrationBuilder`
    are added.
    :class:`qiskit.transpiler.passes.optimization.normalize_rx_angle.NormalizeRXAngle`,
    wraps RX gate rotation angles to [0, pi]. Moreover, it replaces RX(pi/2) to SX
    and RX(pi) to X if the corresponding calibrations are available in the target.
    For negative rotation angles, this pass replaces a RX(-theta) with a sequence: 
    RZ(pi)-RX(theta)-RZ(-pi). This pass should be run before the
    :class:`qiskit.transpiler.passes.calibration.rx_builder.RXCalibrationBuilder`.
    This way, the number of calibrations generated by the :class:`qiskit.transpiler.passes.calibration.rx_builder.RXCalibrationBuilder`
    could be reduced, making the communication payload smaller. 
    :class:`qiskit.transpiler.passes.calibration.rx_builder.RXCalibrationBuilder`
    generates single-pulse calibrations for RX gates on-the-fly.
    The pulse calibrations are bootstrapped from the SX gate calibration in the target.
    The amplitude is linearly scaled to achieve the desired arbitrary rotation angle.
    Using such single-pulse calibrations, instead of the conventional sequence that
    consists of two SX pulses, reduces the gate time in half. 
    There could be an improvement in fidelity due to this reduction in gate time.
