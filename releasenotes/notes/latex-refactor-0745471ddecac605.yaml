deprecations:
  - |
    Deprecated two functions
    (```~qiskit.visualization.state_visualization.num_to_latex_ket``` and
    ```~qiskit.visualization.state_visualization.num_to_latex_terms```).
other:
  - |
    The latex array drawer (e.g. ```array_to_latex```,
    ```Statevector.draw('latex')```) now uses the same sympy function as the
    ket-convention drawer. This means it may render some numbers differently
    (e.g. may identify new factors, or rationalize denominators where it did
    not previously). The default ```precision``` has been changed from 5 to 10.
