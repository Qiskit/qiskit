deprecations:
  - |
    Two mostly internal functions in ``qiskit.visualization.state_visualization``,
    ``num_to_latex_ket`` and ``num_to_latex_terms``, have been deprecated and will
    be removed no sooner than Qiskit Terra 0.25.  These were old internal worker
    functions that are no longer used.  For similar functionality, look at Sympy's
    ``nsimplify`` and ``latex`` functions.
upgrade:
  - |
    The LaTeX array drawers (e.g. ``array_to_latex``,
    ``Statevector.draw('latex')``) now use the same sympy function as the
    ket-convention drawer. This means it may render some numbers differently
    to previous releases, but will provide a more consistent experience.
    For example, it may identify new factors, or rationalize denominators where
    it did not previously. The default ``precision`` has been changed from 5 to
    10.
