    A new method for constructing :class:`qiskit.dagcircuit.DAGCircuit` objects
    has been added, :meth:`~qiskit.dagcircuit.DAGCircuit.from_networkx`. This
    method takes in a networkx ``MultiDiGraph`` object (in the format returned
    by :meth:`~qiskit.dagcircuit.DAGCircuit.to_networkx`) and will return a
    new :class:`~qiskit.dagcircuit.DAGCircuit` object. The intent behind this
    function is to enable transpiler pass authors to leverage networkx's
    `graph algorithm library
    <https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/reference/algorithms/index.html>`__
    if a function is missing from the
    `retworkx API <https://retworkx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html>`_.
    Although, hopefully in such casses an issue will be opened with
    `retworkx issue tracker <https://github.com/Qiskit/retworkx/issues>`__ (or
    even better a pull request submitted).
