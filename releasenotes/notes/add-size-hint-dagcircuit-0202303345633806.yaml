    Added two new keyword arguments, ``node_count_hint`` and ``edge_count_hint`` to the constructor
    of the :class:`.DAGCircuit` class. These new arguments are used to provide size hints when
    building a new :class:`.DAGCircuit`. These hints are used to reduce the number of memory
    allocations when working with a :class:`.DAGCircuit` and will be used to pre-allocate the
    memory which will result in a runtime improvement. When set these arguments are used there
    is no difference in behavior except the underyling memory is allocated up front.
