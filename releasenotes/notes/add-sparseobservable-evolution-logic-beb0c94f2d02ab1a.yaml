    The evolution of :class:`~.quantum_info.SparseObservable` under conjugation is
    implemented using a precomputed static lookup table for single-qubit
    :class:`~.quantum_info.SparseObservable.BitTerm` conjugation.

    This table encodes the full :math:`P^\dagger Q P` conjugation rules for all
    supported BitTerms,
    These include ``X``, ``Y``, ``Z``;
    ``+`` and ``-``; ``l`` and ``r``;
    and the computational-basis projectors ``0`` and ``1``
    Each entry yields either zero or a minimal list of resulting BitTerms together
    with their associated complex coefficients.

    The lookup table was generated with a brute force generator using Qiskit's
    :class:`~.quantum_info.SparseObservable` API and verified through tests.
    This design avoids runtime matrix operations and enables deterministic,
    allocation-free evolution with exact algebraic semantics.

    As an example::

        from qiskit.quantum_info import SparseObservable, Pauli

        # SparseObservable to be evolved
        obs = SparseObservable("Y")

        # Conjugating operator
        pauli = Pauli("X")

        # Evolution via lookup table
        evolved = obs.evolve(pauli)

    This lookup-table–based conjugation forms the core of the
    :meth:`~.quantum_info.SparseObservable.evolve` implementation and provides a
    foundation for future extensions to cross-term and multi-term evolution.
