deprecations:
  - |
    Two ``QuantumCircuit`` methods ``+``, ``+=``, ``combine`` and ``extend`` are deprecated,
    in favor of ``QuantumCircuit.compose()``. The latter allows more flexibility
    in composing two circuits that do not have matching registers. It does not,
    however, automatically add qubits/clbits unlike the deprecated methods.
    To add a circuit on new qubits/clbits, ``QuantumCircuit.tensor`` can be used.

    .. code::

        from qiskit.circuit import QuantumRegister, QuantumCircuit

        a = QuantumRegister(2, 'a')
        circuit_a = QuantumCircuit(a)
        circuit_a.cx(0, 1)

        b = QuantumRegister(2, 'b')
        circuit_b = QuantumCircuit(b)
        circuit_b.cz(0, 1)

        # same as circuit_a + circuit_b (or combine)
        added_with_different_regs = circuit_b.tensor(circuit_a)

        # same as circuit_a + circuit_a (or combine)
        added_with_same_regs = circuit_a.compose(circuit_a)

        # same as circuit_a += circuit_b (or extend)
        circuit_a = circuit_b.tensor(circuit_a)

        # same as circuit_a += circuit_a (or extend)
        circuit_a.compose(circuit_a, inplace=True)
