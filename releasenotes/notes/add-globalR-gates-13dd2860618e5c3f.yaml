    Added global R (GR) gates, in addition to global Rx (GRx) and global Ry (GRy)
    gates, derived from the GR gate, and global Rz (GRz) that is defined in a 
    similar way to the GR gates. The global R gates are defined on a number of
    qubits simultaneously, and act as a direct sum of R gates on each qubit.

  - | 
    The global R gates are defined in ``qiskit.circuit.library.generalized_gates``
    in ``gr.py``. The global R gates will perform an approprate R gate on each qubit.
    For example::

      from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, QuantumRegister      
      import numpy as np

      num_qubits = 3
      qr = QuantumRegister(num_qubits)
      qc = QuantumCircuit(qr)

      qc.compose(GR(num_qubits, theta=np.pi/3, phi=2*np.pi/3), inplace=True)

    will create a QuantumCircuit on a QuantumRegister of 3 qubits and perform a
    RGate of an angle theta=np.pi/3 about an axis in the xy-plane of the Bloch
    spheres that makes an angle of phi=2*np.pi/3 with the x-axis on each qubit.
