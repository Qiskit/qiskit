    Fixed two bugs in the :class:`.ComposedOp` where the :meth:`.ComposedOp.to_matrix`
    method did not provide the correct results for compositions with :class:`.StateFn`
    and for compositions with a global coefficient.
    Fixed `#9283 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/9283>__`.
