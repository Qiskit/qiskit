    Fixed a series of bugs when processing circuits with parameterized global phases
    in which the global phase was not properly assigned during parameter assignment.
    Known cases this affected include:

    * assigning parameters after calling :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.decompose` on a circuit, 
      where the decomposition introduces a global phase
    * assigning parameters on a circuit constructed from a DAG via :func:`.dag_to_circuit`
    * assigning parameters on circuits created with :func:`.pauli_twirl_2q_gates`, where 
      the circuit to be twirled had a parameterized global phase

    Fixed `#13534 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/13534>`__.
