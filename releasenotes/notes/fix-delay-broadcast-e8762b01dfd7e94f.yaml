    The qubit-argument broadcasting of :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.delay` now correctly produces
    individual :class:`~.circuit.Delay` instructions for each qubit, as intended.  Previously, when
    given certain iterables (such as :class:`set`\ s), it would instead silently produce an invalid
    circuit that might fail in unusual locations.
