features:
  - |
    A new :class:`.Operation` base class for objects that can be added to a :class:`.QuantumCircuit`.
    These objects include :class:`.Gate`, :class:`.Reset`, :class:`.Barrier`, :class:.Measure`,
    and operators such as :class:`.Clifford`.
  - |
    A Clifford gate is now added to a quantum circuit as an :class:`.Operation`, without first
    synthesizing a subcircuit implementing this Clifford gate. The actual synthesis is postponed
    to a later transpilation pass.
  - |
    Added a new transpiler pass :class:`.OptimizeCliffords` that collects blocks of consecutive
    Clifford gates in a circuit, and replaces each block with a single Clifford object.
