upgrade:
  - |
    The behaviour of :func:`~.marginal_counts` method on the `memory` field of experiment data has changed.
    Previously, the `memory` field was not marginalized. In this release the `memory` field is 
    marginalized by default. The old behaviour can be restored by setting `marginalize_memory=None`
    as an argument to :func:`~.marginal_counts`.

features:
  - |
    Update the :func:`~.marginal_counts` method to marginalize the memory field of the data.
    For example, if `result`  is a qiskit :class:`~.Result` object obtained from a 4-qubit measurement we can
    marginalize onto the first qubit with as::

        print(result.results[0].data.memory)
        marginal_result = marginal_counts(result, [0])
        print(marginal_result.results[0].data.memory)
    
    The output is as::
    
        ['0x0', '0x1', '0x2', '0x3', '0x4', '0x5', '0x6', '0x7']
        ['0x0', '0x1', '0x0', '0x1', '0x0', '0x1', '0x0', '0x1']
