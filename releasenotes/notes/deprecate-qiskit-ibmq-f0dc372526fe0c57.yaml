deprecations:
  - |
    The ``qiskit.IBMQ`` object is deprecated. This alias object lazily redirects
    attribute access to ``qiskit.providers.ibmq.IBMQ``. As the
    ``qiskit-ibmq-provider`` package has been supersceded by
    ``qiskit-ibm-provider`` package which maintains its own namespace
    maintaining this alias is no longer relevant with the new package. If you
    were relying on the ``qiskit.IBMQ`` alias you should update your usage
    to use ``qiskit.providers.ibmq.IBMQ`` directly instead (and also consider
    migrating to ``qiskit-ibm-provider``).
