    The use of the ``*`` (``__mul__``) for the :meth:`~qiskit.quantum_info.Operator.dot` method and
    ``@`` (``__matmul__``) for the :meth:`~qiskit.quantum_info.Operator.compose` method of the
    ``BaseOperator`` (which is the parent o all the operator classes in :mod:`qiskit.quantum_info` including
    classes like :class:`~qiskit.quantum_info.Operator` and :class:`~qiskit.quantum_info.Pauli` is no longer
    supported. The use of these operators were previously deprecated in 0.17.0 release. Instead you should
    directly use the :meth:`~qiskit.quantum_info.Operator.dot` and
    :meth:`~qiskit.quantum_info.Operator.compose` methods directly. Also, the ``&`` operator (`__and__`)
    can be for :meth:`~qiskit.quantum_info.Operator.compose`. For example, if you were previously
    using the operator like::

        from qiskit.quantum_info import random_operator

        op_a = random_operator(4)
        op_b = random_operator(4)

        new_op = op_a @ op_b

    this should be changed to be::

        from qiskit.quantum_info import random_operator

        op_a = random_operator(4)
        op_b = random_operator(4)
        new_op = op_a.compose(op_b)

    or::

        new_op = op_a & op_b
