    Removed the ``qiskit.quantum_info.synthesis`` module, which has been deprecated since the 0.46 release.
    The following objects have been moved to :mod:`qiskit.synthesis`:

    * :class:`~.OneQubitEulerDecomposer` has been moved to :mod:`qiskit.synthesis.one_qubit`
    * :class:`~.TwoQubitBasisDecomposer` has been moved to :mod:`qiskit.synthesis.two_qubits`
    * :class:`~.XXDecomposer` has been moved to :mod:`qiskit.synthesis.two_qubits`
    * :func:`~.two_qubit_cnot_decompose` has been moved to :mod:`qiskit.synthesis.two_qubits`
    * :func:`~.qs_decomposition` has been moved to :mod:`qiskit.synthesis.unitary`

    The class :class:`.Quaternion` has been migrated from :mod:`qiskit.quantum_info.synthesis` to
    :mod:`qiskit.quantum_info`. This move has not affected the usual import path of the class.

    This function has been deprecated:
    * :func:`~.cnot_rxx_decompose`
