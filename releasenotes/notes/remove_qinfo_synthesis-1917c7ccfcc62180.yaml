features:
  - |
    A new class, :class:`~.TwoQubitWeylDecomposition`, has been added to :mod:`qiskit.synthesis`.
    This class allows to apply the Weyl decomposition of two-qubit unitaries.

upgrade:
  - |
    Removed the ``qiskit.quantum_info.synthesis`` module, which has been deprecated since the 0.46 release.
    The following objects have been moved to :mod:`qiskit.synthesis`:

    * :class:`~.OneQubitEulerDecomposer` has been moved to :mod:`qiskit.synthesis.one_qubit`
    * :class:`~.TwoQubitBasisDecomposer` has been moved to :mod:`qiskit.synthesis.two_qubits`
    * :class:`~.XXDecomposer` has been moved to :mod:`qiskit.synthesis.two_qubits`
    * :func:`~.two_qubit_cnot_decompose` has been moved to :mod:`qiskit.synthesis.two_qubits`

    This function was removed, since it has already been deprecated in the 0.46 release:
    * ``cnot_rxx_decompose``

    These functions were removed, since they have already been deprecated in a previous release:
    * ``decompose_clifford`` (use :func:`.qiskit.synthesis.synth_clifford_full` instead)
    * ``decompose_cnotdihedral`` (use :func:`.qiskit.synthesis.synth_cnotdihedral_full` instead)
