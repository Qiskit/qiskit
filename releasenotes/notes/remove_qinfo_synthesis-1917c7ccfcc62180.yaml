    Removed the ``qiskit.quantum_info.synthesis`` module, which has been deprecated since the 0.46 release.
    The following objects have been moved to :mod:`qiskit.synthesis`:

    * :class:`~.OneQubitEulerDecomposer` has been moved to :mod:`qiskit.synthesis.one_qubit`
    * :class:`~.TwoQubitBasisDecomposer` has been moved to :mod:`qiskit.synthesis.two_qubits`
    * :class:`~.XXDecomposer` has been moved to :mod:`qiskit.synthesis.two_qubits`
    * :func:`~.two_qubit_cnot_decompose` has been moved to :mod:`qiskit.synthesis.two_qubits`

    This function was removed, since it has already been deprecated in the 0.46 release:
    * ``cnot_rxx_decompose``
