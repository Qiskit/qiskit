    Previously, when creating decomposition of controlled unitary gate
    using Isometry, global phase differences in the decomposition were
    corrected by applying single qubit gates. This PR instead just
    sets the global phase of the circuit definition to this phase
    correction.

    Fixes a bug where setting ctrl_state of a `UnitaryGate` would
    apparently have no effect. In reality it was happening twice; once
    in the creation of the matrix for the controlled unitary and again
    when calling the `definition` method of the `ControlledGate`
    class.
