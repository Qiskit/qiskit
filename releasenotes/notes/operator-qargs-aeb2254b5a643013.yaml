    Adds the ability to set `qargs` to BaseOperator subclass objects. This is done
    using the call method `op(qargs)` and returns a shallow copy of the original
    object with a qargs property set. When such an object is used with the
    ``compose`` or ``dot`` methods the internal value for qargs will be used
    when the `qargs` method kwarg is not used. This allows for subsystem
    composition using binary operators for example:

    .. code::

        init = Operator.from_label('III')
        x = Operator.from_label('X')
        h = Opeator.from_label('H')
        init @ x([0]) @ h([1])
