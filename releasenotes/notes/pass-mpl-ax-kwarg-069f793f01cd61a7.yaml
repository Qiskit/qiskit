    An ``ax`` kwarg has been added to the following visualization functions:

     * ``qiskit.visualization.plot_histogram``
     * ``qiskit.visualization.plot_state_paulivec``
     * ``qiskit.visualization.plot_state_qsphere``
     * ``qiskit.visualization.circuit_drawer`` (``mpl`` backend only)
     * ``qiskit.QuantumCircuit.draw`` (``mpl`` backend only)

    This kwarg is used to pass in a ``matplotlib.axes.Axes`` object to the
    visualization functions. This enables integrating these visualization
    functions into a larger visualization workflow. Also, if an `ax` kwarg is
    specified then there is no return from the visualization functions.

    An ``ax_real`` and ``ax_imag`` kwarg has been added to the
    following visualization functions:

     * ``qiskit.visualization.plot_state_hinton``
     * ``qiskit.visualization.plot_state_city``

    These new kargs work the same as the newly added ``ax`` kwargs for other
    visualization functions. However because these plots use two axes (one for
    the real component, the other for the imaginary component). Having two
    kwargs also provides the flexibility to only generate a visualization for
    one of the components instead of always doing both. For example::

        from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
        from qiskit.visualization import plot_state_hinton

        ax = plt.gca()

        plot_state_hinton(psi, ax_real=ax)

    will only generate a plot of the real component.
