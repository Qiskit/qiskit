    Added a new parameter ``max_trials`` to pass :class:`~.VF2PostLayout`
    which, when specified, limits the number of layouts discovered and
    compared when searching for the best layout.
    This differs from existing parameters ``call_limit`` and ``time_limit``
    (which are used to limit the number of state visits performed by the VF2
    algorithm and the total time spent by pass :class:`~.VF2PostLayout`,
    respectively) in that it is used to place an upper bound on the time
    spent scoring potential layouts, which may be useful for larger
    devices.
