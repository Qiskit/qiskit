    Added a new parameter ``max_trials`` to pass :class:`~.VF2PostLayout`
    which, when specified,limits the number of trials performed when
    searching for the best layout. Previously, all possible layouts were
    always considered, which is not suitable when performing layout of
    multiple connected components on large devices.
