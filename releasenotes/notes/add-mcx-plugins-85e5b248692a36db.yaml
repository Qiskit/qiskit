features_synthesis:
  - |
    Added synthesis functions :func:`.synth_mcx_gray_code` and :func:`.synth_mcx_noaux_v24`
    that synthesize multi-controlled X gates. These functions do not require additional
    ancilla qubits.
  - |
    Added synthesis functions :func:`.synth_c3x` and  :func:`.synth_c4x` that
    synthesize 3-controlled and 4-controlled X-gates respectively.
features_transpiler:
  - |
    Added multiple high-level-synthesis plugins for synthesizing an :class:`.MCXGate`:

    * :class:`.MCXSynthesisNCleanM15`, based on :func:`.synth_mcx_n_clean_m15`.
    * :class:`.MCXSynthesisNDirtyI15`, based on :func:`.synth_mcx_n_dirty_i15`.
    * :class:`.MCXSynthesis1CleanB95`, based on :func:`.synth_mcx_1_clean_b95`.
    * :class:`.MCXSynthesisNoAuxV24`, based on :func:`.synth_mcx_noaux_v24`.
    * :class:`.MCXSynthesisGrayCode`, based on :func:`.synth_mcx_gray_code`.

    As well:

    * :class:`.MCXSynthesisGrayDefault`, choosing the most efficient synthesis
      method based on the number of clean and dirty ancilla qubits available.

deprecations:
  - |
    The classes :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.MCXGrayCode`,
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.MCXRecursive`, and
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.MCXVChain` are pending deprecation.
    They will be deprecated in the future release and subsequently removed
    after that.
    One will still be able to create custom MCX decompositions using the
    functions :func:`.synth_mcx_n_clean_m15`, :func:`.synth_mcx_n_dirty_i15`,
    :func:`.synth_mcx_1_clean_b95`, and :func:`.synth_mcx_gray_code`.
    In most cases, however, it should be better to define an :class:`.MCXGate`
    specifying only the control and target qubits (but not the ancillas), and
    let the :class:`.HighLevelSynthesis` pass choose the most efficient synthesis
    method based on the number of clean and dirty qubits available.
