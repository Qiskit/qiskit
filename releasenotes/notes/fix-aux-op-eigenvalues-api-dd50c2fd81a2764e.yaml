    Fixes a regression of the `aux_op_eigenvalues` API which caused a mismatch
    of the return types between the `NumPyEigensolver` and the `VQE`. In general,
    this part of the API was poorly documented which is also adressed.
    It is now evident that each auxiliary operator will return a tuple with its
    mean expected value and standard deviation (although support for the standard
    deviation is yet to be added in the future, so for now it always defaults to
    being zero).
