    Fixes a regression of the `aux_op_eigenvalues` API which caused a mismatch
    of the return types between the `NumPyEigensolver` and the `VQE`. In general,
    this part of the API was poorly documented which is also adressed.
    It is now evident that each auxiliary operator will return a tuple with its
    mean expected value and standard deviation.
