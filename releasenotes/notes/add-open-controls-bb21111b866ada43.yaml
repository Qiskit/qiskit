    Add ability to specify control conditioned on a qubit being in the
    ground state. The state of the control qubits is represented by a
    decimal integer. For example:

      from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
      from qiskit.extensions.standard import XGate

      qc = QuantumCircuit(4)
      cgate = XGate().control(3, ctrl_state=6)
      qc.append(cgate, [0, 1, 2, 3])

    Creates a four qubit gate where the fourth qubit gets flipped if
    the first qubit is in the ground state and the second and third
    qubits are in the excited state. If ctrl_state is None, the
    default, control is conditioned on all control qubits being
    excited.
