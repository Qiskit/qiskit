deprecations:
  - |
    Extensions of the ``qiskit`` and ``qiskit.providers`` namespaces by external
    packages are now deprecated and the hook points enabling this will be
    removed in a future release. In the past, the Qiskit project was composed
    of elements that extended a shared namespace and these hook points enabled
    doing that. However, it was not intended for these interfaces to ever be
    used by other packages. Now that the overall Qiskit package is no longer
    using that packaging model, leaving the possibility for these extensions
    carry more risk than benefits and is therefore being deprecated for
    future removal. If you're maintaining a package that extends the Qiskit
    namespace (i.e. your users import from ``qiskit.x`` or
    ``qiskit.providers.y``) you should transition to using a standalone
    Python namespace for your package. No warning will be raised as part of this
    because there is no method to inject a warning at the packaging level that
    would be required to warn external packages of this change.
