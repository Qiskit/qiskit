upgrade:
  - |
    The value of the ``rep_time`` parameter for Pulse backend's configuration
    object are now in units of seconds, not microseconds. The first time a
    ``PulseBackendConfiguration`` object is initialized it will raise a single
    warning to the user to indicate this.
  - |
    The ``rep_time`` argument for :func:`qiskit.compiler.assemble` now takes
    in a value in units of seconds, not microseconds. This was done to make
    the units with everything else in pulse. If you were passing in a value for
    ``rep_time`` ensure that you update the value to account for this change.
