deprecations:
  - |
    The ``scaling`` parameter of the ``draw()`` method for the ``Schedule`` and
    ``Pulse`` objects was deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
    Instead the new ``scale`` parameter should be used. This was done to have
    a consistent argument between pulse and circuit drawings. For example::

        #The consistency in parameters is seen below
        #For circuits
        circuit = QuantumCircuit()
        circuit.draw(scale=0.2)
        #For pulses
        pulse = SamplePulse()
        pulse.draw(scale=0.2)
        #For schedules
        schedule = Schedule()
        schedule.draw(scale=0.2)
