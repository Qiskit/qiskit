features:
  - |
    Within the terra API allow acquires be applied to a single qubit.
    This makes pulse programming more consistent and easier to reason
    about as all operations in pulse would then be for single channels.
    For example::

      acquire = Acquire(duration=10)
      schedule = Schedule()
      schedule.insert(60, acquire(AcquireChannel(0), MemorySlot(0), RegisterSlot(0)))
      schedule.insert(60, acquire(AcquireChannel(1), MemorySlot(1), RegisterSlot(1)))

deprecations:
  - |
    Acquire on multiple qubits has been deprecated.
    ``AcquireInstruction`` parameters ``mem_slots``, ``reg_slots`` has been
    deprecated, use ``reg_slot``, ``mem_slot`` instead.
