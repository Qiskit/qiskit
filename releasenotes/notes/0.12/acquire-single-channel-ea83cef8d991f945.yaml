features:
  - |
    :class:`qiskit.pulse.Acquire` can now be applied to a single qubit.
    This makes pulse programming more consistent and easier to reason
    about, as now all operations in now apply to a single channel.
    For example::

      acquire = Acquire(duration=10)
      schedule = Schedule()
      schedule.insert(60, acquire(AcquireChannel(0), MemorySlot(0), RegisterSlot(0)))
      schedule.insert(60, acquire(AcquireChannel(1), MemorySlot(1), RegisterSlot(1)))

deprecations:
  - |
    Running :class:`qiskit.pulse.Acquire` on multiple qubits has been
    deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Additionally, the
    :class:`qiskit.pulse.AcquireInstruction` parameters ``mem_slots`` and
    ``reg_slots`` have been deprecated. Instead ``reg_slot`` and ``mem_slot``
    should be used instead.
