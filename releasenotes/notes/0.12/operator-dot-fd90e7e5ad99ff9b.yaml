features:
  - |
    Added a new abstract method
    :meth:`qiskit.quantum_info.Operator.dot` to
    the abstract ``BaseOperator`` class, so it is included for all
    implementations of that abstract
    class, including :class:`qiskit.quantum_info.Operator` and
    ``QuantumChannel`` (e.g., :class:`qiskit.quantum_info.Choi`)
    objects. This method returns the right operator multiplication
    ``a.dot(b)`` :math:`= a \cdot b`. This is equivalent to
    calling the operator
    :meth:`qiskit.quantum_info.Operator.compose` method with the kwarg
    ``front`` set to ``True``.
upgrade:
  - |
    Changed :class:`qiskit.quantum_info.Operator` magic methods so that
    ``__mul__`` (which gets executed by python's multiplication operation,
    if the left hand side of the operation has it defined) implements right
    matrix multiplication (i.e. :meth:`qiskit.quantum_info.Operator.dot`), and
    ``__rmul__`` (which gets executed by python's multiplication operation
    from the right hand side of the operation if the left does not have
    ``__mul__`` defined) implements scalar multiplication (i.e.
    :meth:`qiskit.quantum_info.Operator.multiply`). Previously both methods
    implemented scalar multiplication.
