    Pulse :class:`qiskit.pulse.Schedule` objects now have better
    representations that for simple schedules should be valid Python
    expressions.

    for example:

    .. jupyter-execute::
       :hide-code:
       :hide-output:

       import warnings
       warnings.simplefilter("ignore")

    .. jupyter-execute::

        from qiskit import pulse

        sched = pulse.Schedule(name='test')
        sched += pulse.SamplePulse(
            [0., 0,], name='test_pulse')(pulse.DriveChannel(0))
        sched += pulse.FrameChange(1.0)(pulse.DriveChannel(0))
        print(sched)
