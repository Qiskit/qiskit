    The decomposition methods for single-qubit gates in
    :class:`qiskit.quantum_info.synthesis.one_qubit_decompose.OneQubitEulerDecomposer` have been expanded to now
    also include the ``'ZXZ'`` basis, characterized by three rotations about
    the  Z,X,Z axis. This now means that a general 2x2 Operator can be
    decomposed into following bases: ``U3``, ``U1X``, ``ZYZ``, ``ZXZ``,
    ``XYX``, ``ZXZ``.
