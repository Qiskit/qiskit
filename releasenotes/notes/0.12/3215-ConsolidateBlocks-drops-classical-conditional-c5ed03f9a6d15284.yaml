    The ``Collect2qBlocks`` pass had previously not considered classical
    conditions when determining whether to include a gate within an
    existing block. In some cases, this resulted in classical
    conditions being lost when transpiling with
    ``optimization_level=3``. This has been resolved so that classically
    conditioned gates are never included in a block.
    Fixes `issue #3215 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/3215>`_
