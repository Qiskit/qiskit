    The pass :class:`qiskit.transpiler.passes.CSPLayout` was extended with two
    new parameters: ``call_limit`` and ``time_limit``. These options allow to
    limit how long this pass will run. The option ``call_limit`` limits the
    amount of time that the recursive function in the backtracking solver is
    called. Similarly, ``call_limit`` limits how long (in seconds) the solver
    will be running. The defaults are ``1000`` calls and ``10`` seconds
    respectively.
