deprecations:
  - |
    The attribute of the :class:`qiskit.providers.models.PulseDefaults` class
    ``circuit_instruction_map`` has been deprecated and will be removed in a
    future release. Instead you should use the new attribute
    ``instruction_schedule_map``. This was done to match the type of the
    value of the attribute, which is an ``InstructionScheduleMap``.
