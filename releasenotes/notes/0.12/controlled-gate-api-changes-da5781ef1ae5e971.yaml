upgrade:
  - |
    The value of the ``base_gate`` property of
    :class:`qiskit.circuit.ControlledGate` objects has been changed from the
    class of the base gate to an instance of the class of the base gate.
  - |
    The ``base_gate_name`` property of :class:`qiskit.circuit.ControlledGate`
    has been removed, you can get the name of the base gate by either accessing
    ``base_gate.name`` on the object. For example::

        from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
        from qiskit.extensions import HGate

        qc = QuantumCircuit(3)
        cch_gate = HGate().control(2)
        base_gate_name = cch_gate.base_gate.name
