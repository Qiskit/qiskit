issues:
  - |
    Running functions that use :func:`qiskit.tools.parallel_map` (for example
    :func:`qiskit.execute.execute`, :func:`qiskit.compiler.transpile`, and
    :meth:`qiskit.transpiler.PassManager.run`) may not work when
    called from a script running outside of a ``if __name__ == '__main__':``
    block when using Python 3.8 on MacOS. Other environments are uneffected by
    this issue. This is due to changes in how parallel processes are launched
    by Python 3.8 on MacOS. If ``RuntimeError`` or ``AttributeError`` are
    raised by scripts that are directly calling ``parallel_map()`` or when
    calling a function that uses it internally with Python 3.8 on MacOS
    embedding the script calls inside ``if __name__ == '__main__':`` should
    workaround the issue. For example::

        from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, QiskitError
        from qiskit import execute, BasicAer

        qc1 = QuantumCircuit(2, 2)
        qc1.h(0)
        qc1.cx(0, 1)
        qc1.measure([0,1], [0,1])
        # making another circuit: superpositions
        qc2 = QuantumCircuit(2, 2)
        qc2.h([0,1])
        qc2.measure([0,1], [0,1])
        execute([qc1, qc2], BasicAer.get_backend('qasm_simulator'))

    should be changed to::

        from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, QiskitError
        from qiskit import execute, BasicAer

        def main():
            qc1 = QuantumCircuit(2, 2)
            qc1.h(0)
            qc1.cx(0, 1)
            qc1.measure([0,1], [0,1])
            # making another circuit: superpositions
            qc2 = QuantumCircuit(2, 2)
            qc2.h([0,1])
            qc2.measure([0,1], [0,1])
            execute([qc1, qc2], BasicAer.get_backend('qasm_simulator'))

        if __name__ == '__main__':
            main()

    if errors are encountered with Python 3.8 on MacOS.

deprecations:
  - |
    Python 3.5 support in qiskit-terra is deprecated. Support will be
    removed in the first release after the upstream Python community's end of
    life date for the version, which is 09/13/2020.
