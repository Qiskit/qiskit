    Previously, calling :meth:`qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.bind_parameters`
    prior to decomposing a circuit would result in the bound values not being
    correctly substituted into the decomposed gates. This has been resolved
    such that binding and decomposition may occur in any order. Fixes
    `issue #2482 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/2482>`_ and
    `issue #3509 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/3509>`_
