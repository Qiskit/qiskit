    The 0.12.0 release includes several new features and bug fixes. The biggest
    changes for this release is the addition of support for parametric pulses
    to OpenPulse. These are Pulse commands which take parameters rather than
    sample points to describe a pulse. 0.12.0 is also the first release to
    include support for Python 3.8. It also marks the beginning of the
    deprecation for Python 3.5 support, which will be removed when the upstream
    community stops supporting it.
