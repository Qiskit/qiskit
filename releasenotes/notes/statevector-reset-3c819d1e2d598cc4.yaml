features:
  - |
    Add support for :class:`~qiskit.circuit.Reset` instructions to
    :meth:`qiskit.quantum_info.Statevector.from_instruction`. Note that this
    involves RNG sampling in choosing the projection to the zero state in the
    case where the qubit is in a superposition state. The seed for sampling
    can be set using the :meth:`~qiskit.quantum_info.Statevector.seed` method.
fixes:
  - |
    Fixes issue where initializing or evolving :class:`qiskit.quantum_info.Statevector`
    and  :class:`qiskit.quantum_info.DensityMatrix` classes by circuits by
    circuit containing :class:`~qiskit.circuit.Barrier` instructions would raise
    an exception.
