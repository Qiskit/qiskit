    Added a new instruction class, :class:`.PauliProductMeasurement`, which represents
    a joint projective measurement on multiple qubits, where the measured observable is 
    a tensor product of Pauli operators.
    The outcome of this measurement is a single eigenvalue, either :math:`+1` or :math:`-1`,
    indicating the eigenstate of the Pauli product.

    For additional background, see
    "A Game of Surface Codes: Large-Scale Quantum Computing with Lattice Surgery" by
    Daniel Litinski (https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.02892).

    A :class:`.PauliProductMeasurement` can be instantiated from a 
    :class:`~.quantum_info.Pauli`, where the Pauli may include a phase of :math:`-1`,
    but not of :math:`i` or :math:`-i`. The instruction has the same number of qubits as
    the Pauli, and exactly :math:`1` classical bit.

    As an example::

        from qiskit.circuit import QuantumCircuit
        from qiskit.quantum_info import Pauli
        from qiskit.circuit.library import PauliProductMeasurement

        ppm = PauliProductMeasurement(Pauli("XZ"))

        qc = QuantumCircuit(6, 2)
        qc.append(ppm, [4, 1], [1])
