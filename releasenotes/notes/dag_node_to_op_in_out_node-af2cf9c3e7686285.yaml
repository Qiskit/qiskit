    The :class:`qiskit.dagcircuit.DAGNode` is being deprecated as a
    standalone class and will be used in the future only as the parent class
    for :class:`qiskit.dagcircuit.OpNode`, :class:`qiskit.dagcircuit.InNode`,
    and :class:`qiskit.dagcircuit.OutNode`. As part of this deprecation, the
    following kwargs in DAGNode are being deprecated - ``type``, ``op``,
    and ``wire``.
