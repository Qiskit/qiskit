title: Pauli Basis measurement helper function

    Added a new method :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.measure_pauli_basis` to measure a qubit
    in any Pauli basis (X, Y, or Z).  

    - Measurements always occur physically in the Z basis.  
    - X-basis measurement applies a Hadamard before measurement.  
    - Y-basis measurement applies S† followed by Hadamard before measurement.  
    - Z-basis measurement is performed directly.  

    Introduced the :class:`.PauliBasis` enum (`X`, `Y`, `Z`) to specify the measurement basis.
