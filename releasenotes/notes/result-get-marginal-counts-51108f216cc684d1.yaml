features:
  - |
    A new method `get_marginal_counts` is added to the Result class
    which allows marginalization of the counts over some indices of interest.
    This is useful when more qubits are measured than needed, and one wishes
    to get the observation counts for some subset of them only.
deprecations:
  - |
    This function replaces a similar utility function in
    qiskit.ignis.verification.tomography, which will be deprecated.
