    Fixed a bug in :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.assign_parameters`, occurring when assigning parameters
    to standard gates whose definition has already been triggered. In this case, the new values
    were not properly propagated to the gate instances. While the circuit itself was still
    compiled as expected, inspecting the individual operations would still show the old parameter.

    For example::

      from qiskit.circuit.library import EfficientSU2

      circuit = EfficientSU2(2, flatten=True)
      circuit.assign_parameters([1.25] * circuit.num_parameters, inplace=True)
      print(circuit.data[0].operation.params)  # would print Î¸[0] instead of 1.25

    Fixed `#13478 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/13478>`__.
