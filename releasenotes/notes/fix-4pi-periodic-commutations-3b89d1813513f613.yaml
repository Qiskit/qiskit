    The :class:`.CommutationChecker` did not correctly handle commutations of the
    :class:`.CRXGate`, :class:`.CRYGate` and :class:`.CRZGate` for rotation angles
    of the form :math:`(4k + 2)\pi`, with :math:`k \in \mathbb Z`.
    In these cases, these gates were incorrectly assumed to commute with any gate.
    This behavior is now fixed, and these gates correctly commute with any gate only when the rotation
    angle is a multiple of :math:`4\pi`.
