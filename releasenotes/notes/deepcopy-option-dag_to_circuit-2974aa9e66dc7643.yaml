    Added a new option, ``copy_operations``, to :func:`~.dag_to_circuit` to
    enable optionally disabling deep copying the operations from the input
    :class`~.DAGCircuit` to the output :class:`~.QuantumCircuit`. In cases
    where the input :class`~.DAGCircuit` is not used anymore after conversion
    this deep copying is unnecessary overhead as any shared references wouldn't
    have any potential unwanted side effects if the input :class`~.DAGCircuit`
    is discarded.
