  Fixed an issue with :class:`~.BackendV2`\ -based fake backend classes from the
  ``qiskit.providers.fake_provider`` module such as ``FakeMontrealV2``, where the
  values for the :attr:`~.BackendV2.dtm` and :attr:`~.BackendV2.dt` attributes
  and the associated attribute :attr:`.Target.dt` would not be properly
  converted to seconds. This would cause issues when using these fake backends
  with scheduling.  See `#8018 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/8018>`__.
