    Extended the ``[tool.coverage.report]`` ``exclude_also`` list in
    ``pyproject.toml`` to exclude ``@overload`` decorator lines, ellipsis-only
    stub bodies (``...``), and ``if __name__ == '__main__':`` guards from
    Python coverage reporting.
    Also updated the ``grcov`` invocation in the coverage GitHub Actions
    workflow to pass ``--excl-line`` flags that exclude Rust ``unreachable!``,
    ``panic!``, ``todo!``, and ``unimplemented!`` macro call-sites from Rust
    coverage reporting. These patterns are never executed by the test-runner
    and were causing spurious, non-deterministic coverage changes in Coveralls
    reports on pull requests (issue `#7235
    <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/7235>`__).
