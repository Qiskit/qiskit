    The constructor for the :class:`~.Unroll3qOrMore` transpiler pass has
    two new optional keyword arguments, ``target`` and ``basis_gates``. These
    options enable you to specify the :class:`~.Target` or supported basis
    gates respectively to describe the target backend. If any of the operations
    in the circuit are in the ``target`` or ``basis_gates`` those will not
    be unrolled by the pass as the target device has native support for the
    operation.
