    Fixed a regression in the classical expression representation of
    :class:~.expr.Value` of type :class:`~.types.Uint` of width greater
    than 64 bits. Previously, the value of expressions with these types
    was unintentionally coerced into a double floating point value
    internally, resulting in loss of precision.
