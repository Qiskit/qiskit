    The properties ``Bit.register`` and ``Bit.index`` are removed. They were deprecated in
    Qiskit 0.25 (released in April, 2021). The qubits and bits now live only in the context of
    a :class:`.QuantumCircuit`. The alternative to the properties is
    to use :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.find_bit` to find all the containing
    registers within a circuit and the index of the bit within the 
    circuit.
