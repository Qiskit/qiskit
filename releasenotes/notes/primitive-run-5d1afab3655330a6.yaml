features:
  - |
    Add methods `~qiskit.primitives.BaseSampler.run` and `~qiskit.primitives.BaseEstimator.run`.
    These methods execute asynchronously and return `~qiskit.providers.JobV1`.
    Circuits and observables can be appended that are not registered in the constructor.
deprecations:
  - |
    The method of executing primitives has been changed.
    :meth:`~qiskit.primitives.BaseSampler.__call__` method was deprecated and
    :meth:`~qiskit.primitives.BaseEstimator.__call__` method was deprecated.
    For example::

    .. code-block:: python

      estimator = Estimator(...)
      result = estimator(circuits, observables, parameters)

      sampler = Sampler(...)
      result = sampler(circuits, observables, parameters)

    are equivalent by rewriting

    .. code-block:: python

      estimator = Estimator(circuits, observables, parameters)
      result = estimator.run(circuits, observables, parameter_values).result()

      sampler = Sampler(circuits, parameters)
      result = sampler.run(circuits, parameter_values).result()

    Context manager for primitives was deprecated.
    Not all Primitives have a context manager available. When available (e.g. qiskit-ibm-runtime),
    the session's context manager provides equivalent functionality.

    ``circuits``, ``observables``, and ``parameters`` in the constructor was deprecated.
    These objects can be passed from ``run`` methods.
