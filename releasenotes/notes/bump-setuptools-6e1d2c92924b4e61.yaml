    When building or packaging Qiskit from source, the version of `setuptools` required is now at
    least version 77.0 (released in March 2025).  This is to support the new license-metadata
    specifications of `PEP 639 <https://peps.python.org/pep-0639/>`__.  This dependency is specified
    in the build requirements, and so no manual action should be needed.
