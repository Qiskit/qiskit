    Users can request whether the backend inserts any initialization sequences
    at the start of each shot via ``assemble`` or ``execute``. By passing
    ``init_qubits = False``, qubits will be uninitialized at the start of each
    experiment and between shots.

    The default behavior is ``init_qubits = True``, which replicates the
    previously implict behavior: all qubits are assumed to be in the ground
    state at the start of each shot.
