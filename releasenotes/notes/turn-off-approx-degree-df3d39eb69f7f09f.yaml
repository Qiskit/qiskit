    The implicit use of ``approximation_degree!=1.0`` by default in
    in the :func:`~.transpile` function when ``optimization_level=3`` is set has been disabled.  The transpiler should, by default,
    preserve unitarity of the input up to known transformations such as one-sided permutations
    and similarity transformations.  This was broken by the previous use of `approximation_degree=None`
    leading to incorrect results in cases such as Trotterized evolution with many time steps where
    unitaries were being overly approximated leading to incorrect results.  It was decided that
    transformations that break unitary equivilence should be explicitly activated by the user.
