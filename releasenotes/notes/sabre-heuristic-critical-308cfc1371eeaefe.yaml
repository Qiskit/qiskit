    A new feature has been added to the `SabreSwap` pass in Qiskit that introduces 
    a `CriticalHeuristic`. This heuristic allows users to prioritize routing 
    decisions based on the criticality of operations, as determined by the number 
    of descendant gates in the quantum circuit's Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). 
    This enhancement aims to minimize circuit depth by ensuring that more critical 
    operations, which have the most dependent operations, are routed first.

    The `CriticalHeuristic` is a new addition to the `SabreSwap` pass in Qiskit. 
    This heuristic ranks quantum gates based on their criticality, which is determined 
    by the number of descendant gates they have in the circuit's DAG. Gates with more 
    descendants are considered more critical and are prioritized during the routing process.
    
    This heuristic works similarly to the existing ones like "basic," "lookahead," or "decay," 
    but with a focus on ensuring that the critical path of the quantum circuit is minimized. 
    This can lead to more efficient routing by reducing the potential for bottlenecks in 
    the circuit, potentially lowering overall circuit depth.
  
    This new heuristic gives users additional control over the routing process, enabling 
    them to optimize their circuits by focusing on the critical paths, which can be 
    particularly beneficial for complex quantum circuits with many dependencies.
