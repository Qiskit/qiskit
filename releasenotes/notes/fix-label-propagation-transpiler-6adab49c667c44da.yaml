    Fixed an issue where gate labels were inconsistently propagated to
    decomposed sub-gates during basis translation in the built-in transpiler
    pipeline. For example, a :class:`.CXGate` with label ``'hello'`` transpiled
    to a ``{cz, rx, rz}`` basis would produce some output gates carrying the
    ``'hello'`` label due to downstream optimization passes rewriting parts of
    the output. The built-in translation plugins now set
    ``propagate_labels=False`` on :class:`.BasisTranslator` so that labels are
    dropped when gates are decomposed during :func:`.transpile`.
    See `#15168 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/15168>`__.

    Added a ``propagate_labels`` keyword argument to
    :class:`.BasisTranslator`. When ``True`` (the default), gate labels from
    the original gate are copied to each gate in the decomposed replacement
    circuit. When ``False``, labels are dropped during decomposition.
