    The functions ``qiskit.scheduler.utils.format_meas_map``,  ``qiskit.scheduler.utils.measure``, and
    ``qiskit.scheduler.utils.measure_all``
    had been moved to ``qiskit.pulse.utils.format_meas_map``, ``qiskit.pulse.macros.measure``,
    and ``qiskit.pulse.macros.measure_all`` respectively. The previous location was deprecated
    in Qiskit 0.20.0 (Terra 0.15.0, released on 2020-08-10) and it is no longer supported.
