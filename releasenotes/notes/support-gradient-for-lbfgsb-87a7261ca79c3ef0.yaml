    Ensure the :class:`~qiskit.algorithms.optimizers.L_BFGS_B` and 
    :class:`~qiskit.algorithms.optimizers.P_BFGS` optimizers, which expect the gradients
    as a list of floats, are compatible with the the Gradient Framework, which might return a numpy array.
    This fixes the usage of the L_BFGS_B optimizer in the :class:`~qiskit.algorithms.VQE` if gradients
    are used.
