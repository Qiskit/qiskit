    Added convenience functions to the :class:`.QuantumCircuit` class that return the depth in terms of
    gates that have exactly two-qubits (:meth:`.QuantumCircuit.depth_2q`) or at least n-qubits (:meth:`.QuantumCircuit.depth_nq`).
    This also added convenience functions for determining the number of 2-qubit (:meth:`.QuantumCircuit.num_2q_gates`) and n-qubit gates (:meth:`.QuantumCircuit.num_nq_gates`).
    Added a function that returns the number of non-idle qubits in an operation, i.e. qubits that are part of at least one gate (:meth:`.QuantumCircuit.num_nonidle_qubits`).
