    A new kwarg, ``line_discipline``, has been added to the :func:`~qiskit.tools.job_monitor`
    function. This kwarg enables changing the carriage return characters used in the
    ``job_monitor`` output. The ``line_discipline`` kwarg defaults to ``'\r'``, which is what was
    in use before. Refer to `#5690 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/5690>`__ for more details.
