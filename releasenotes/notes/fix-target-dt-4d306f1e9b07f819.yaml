    Fixed an issue with :class:`~.BackendV2` based fake backend classes from the 
    ``qiskit.providers.fake_provider`` module such as ``FakeMontrealV2`` where the
    value for the :attr:`~.BackendV2.dt` attribute (and the :attr:`.Target.dt` attribute) 
    were not properly being converted to seconds. This would cause issues when
    using these fake backends with scheduling.
