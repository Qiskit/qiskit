    Added the :class:`.UnitaryOverlap` circuit to the Qiskit circuit library that
    can be used to compute the fidelity of states generated by unitaries
    by looking at the probability of the output distribution in the all-zeros
    state or, equivalently, by computing the expectation value of the projector
    onto the all-zeros state.  This is useful in applications such as machine
    learning, and computing excited states in quantum chemistry, to name a few.
