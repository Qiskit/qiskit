upgrade:
  - |
    The legacy QASM2 parser module previously present in ``qiskit.qasm`` has
    been removed. It was marked as deprecated in Qiskit 0.46.0 release. The
    QASM2 parser has been superseded by the :mod:`qiskit.qasm2` module which
    provides a faster more correct parser for QASM2.
  - |
    The ``qiskit.converters.ast_to_dag`` function has been removed. It
    previously was used to convert the abstract syntax tree generated by the
    legacy QASM2 parser (in the ``qiskit.qasm`` module which no longer exists)
    and convert that directly to a :class:`.DAGCircuit`. This function was
    marked as deprecated in the Qiskit 0.46.0 release. As the legacy
    QASM2 parser has been removed this function no longer serves a purpose.
    If you were previously using this, you can instead parse your QASM2 files
    into a :class:`.QuantumCircuit` using the
    :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.from_qasm_file` or
    :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.from_qasm_str` constructor methods and then
    converting that :class:`.QuantumCircuit` into a :class:`.DAGCircuit` with
    :func:`.circuit_to_dag`.
