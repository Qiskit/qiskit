upgrade:
  - |
    The legacy OpenQASM 2 parser module previously present in ``qiskit.qasm`` has
    been removed. It was marked as deprecated in Qiskit 0.46.0 release. The
    OpenQASM 2 parser has been superseded by the :mod:`qiskit.qasm2` module which
    provides a faster more correct parser for QASM2.
  - |
    The ``qiskit.converters.ast_to_dag`` function has been removed. It
    previously was used to convert the abstract syntax tree generated by the
    legacy OpenQASM 2 parser (in the ``qiskit.qasm`` module which no longer exists)
    and convert that directly to a :class:`.DAGCircuit`. This function was
    marked as deprecated in the Qiskit 0.46.0 release. As the legacy
    OpenQASM 2 parser has been removed this function no longer serves a purpose.
    If you were previously using this, you can instead parse your OpenQASM 2 files
    into a :class:`.QuantumCircuit` using the
    :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.from_qasm_file` or
    :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.from_qasm_str` constructor methods and then
    converting that :class:`.QuantumCircuit` into a :class:`.DAGCircuit` with
    :func:`.circuit_to_dag`.
  - |
    Removed the ``QuantumCircuit.qasm()`` method to generate a OpenQASM 2
    representation of the :class:`.QuantumCircuit` object. Instead the
    :func:`.qasm2.dump` or :func:`.qasm2.dumps` functions should be used. This
    function was marked as deprecated in the 0.46.0 release. If you were using
    the ``QuantumCircuit.qasm()`` method to generate pygments formatted output
    you should instead look at the standalone ``openqasm-pygments`` package
    to provide this functionality.
  - |
    Removed the ``qiskit.tools.jupyter.library.qasm_widget`` function which
    was used to visualize qasm strings in a jupyter notebook. This function
    was marked as deprecated as part of the Qiskit 0.44.0 release. The function
    was originally used for building documentation but hasn't been used in some
    time and has been removed from Qiskit.
