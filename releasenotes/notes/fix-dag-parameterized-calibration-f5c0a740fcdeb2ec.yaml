    :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.add_calibrations` and :meth:`.DAGCircuit.add_calibrations`
    method have been updated to resolve the mismatch of parameter formatting logic.
    So far one of DAGCircuit tried to typecast every parameter into float,
    while QuantumCircuit used given parameters as-is.
    This has been crashing transpile when the pulse gate to assign
    was kept parameterized throughout the all transpile steps.
    Both methods now have the identical logic to format the gate parameters.
