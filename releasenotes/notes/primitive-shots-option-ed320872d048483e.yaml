    Added ``shots`` option for reference implementations of primitives.
    Random numbers can be fixed by giving ``seed_primitive``. For example::

      from qiskit.primitives import Sampler
      from qiskit import QuantumCircuit

      bell = QuantumCircuit(2)
      bell.h(0)
      bell.cx(0, 1)
      bell.measure_all()

      with Sampler(circuits=[bell]) as sampler:
          result = sampler(circuits=[0], shots=1024, seed_primitive=15)
          print([q.binary_probabilities() for q in result.quasi_dists])
