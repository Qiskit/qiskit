    The ``qiskit.algorithms`` module has been removed, following its deprecation in
    Qiskit 0.44. The primitive-based algorithms from this module have been migrated to a standalone library (``qiskit_algorithms``)
    and can be found on PyPI or `GitHub <https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-algorithms>`_.
    The decision to migrate the algorithms module to a separate package
    was made to clarify the purpose Qiskit and make a distinction between the tools
    and libraries built on top of it.
