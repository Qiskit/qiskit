    A new class, :class:`.GenericBackendV2` has been added to the :mod:`qiskit.providers.fake_provider`
    module. This class is configurable, and builds a :class:`~.BackendV2` backend instance that can
    be run locally (in the spirit of fake backends). Users can configure the number of qubits, basis gates,
    coupling map, ability to run dynamic circuits (control flow instructions), instruction calibrations and
    dtm of the backend without having to deal with manual target construction.
    Qubit and gate properties are generated by randomly sampling from default ranges. The seed for this
    random generation can be fixed to ensure the reproducibility of the backend output.
    It's important to note that this backend only supports gates in the standard
    library. If you need a more flexible backend, there is always the option to directly instantiate a
    :class:`.Target` object to use for transpilation.

    Example usage 1::

      from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, transpile
      from qiskit.providers.fake_provider import GenericBackendV2

      # Create a simple circuit
      circuit = QuantumCircuit(3)
      circuit.h(0)
      circuit.cx(0,1)
      circuit.cx(0,2)
      circuit.measure_all()
      circuit.draw('mpl')

      # Define backend with 3 qubits
      backend = GenericBackendV2(num_qubits=3)

      # Transpile and run
      transpiled_circuit = transpile(circuit, backend)
      result = backend.run(transpiled_circuit).result()

    Example usage 2::

      from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, ClassicalRegister, transpile
      from qiskit.providers.fake_provider import GenericBackendV2

      # Create a circuit with classical control
      creg = ClassicalRegister(19)
      qc = QuantumCircuit(25)
      qc.add_register(creg)
      qc.h(0)
      for i in range(18):
          qc.cx(0, i + 1)
      for i in range(18):
          qc.measure(i, creg[i])
      qc.ecr(20, 21).c_if(creg, 0)

      # Define backend with custom basis gates and control flow instructions
      backend = GenericBackendV2(num_qubits=25, basis_gates = ["ecr","id","rz","sx","x"], control_flow=True)

      #Transpile
      transpiled_qc = transpile(qc, backend)

    .. note::

        The noise properties generated by these class do not mimic any concrete quantum device, and should
        not be used to measure any concrete behaviors. They are "reasonable defaults" that can be used to
        test backend-interfacing functionality not tied specific noise values of real quantum systems.
        For a more accurate simulation of existing devices, you can manually build a noise model from the
        real backend using the functionality offered in ``qiskit-aer``.
