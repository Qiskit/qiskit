upgrade:
  - |
    The deprecated ``NoiseAdaptiveLayout`` transpiler pass has been removed.
    It was marked as deprecated in Qiskit 0.46.0. This pass has been largely
    superseded by :class:`.VF2Layout` and :class:`.VF2PostLayout` which will
    set a layout based on the reported noise characteristics of a backend.
    Along with the pass, the ``layout_method`` plugin ``"noise_adaptive"`` has
    been removed.
  - |
    The deprecated ``CrosstalkAdaptiveSchedule`` transpiler pass has been removed.
    It was marked as deprecated in Qiskit 0.46.0. This pass was not usable any
    longer because its internal operation was dependent on custom properties
    being set in the :class:`.BackendProperties` payload of a
    :class:`.BackendV1` instance. As no backends are setting these fields
    the pass was removed. If you depend on the pass for a custom workflow you
    can use the version in Qiskit 0.46.x.
