upgrade_primitives:
  - |
    Added the :class:`.BasePrimitiveJob` class as an abstract job class for primitives
    and made :class:`.PrimitiveJob` inherit :class:`.BasePrimitiveJob`
    instead of :class:`.JobV1`.
deprecations_primitives:
  - |
    The methods :meth:`.PrimitiveJob.submit` and :meth:`.PrimitiveJob.wait_for_final_state`
    have been removed following their deprecation in Qiskit 0.46.  These were not intended to be
    public methods, but were a legacy of an incorrect inheritance structure.
