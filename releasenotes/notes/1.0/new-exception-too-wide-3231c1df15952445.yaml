    Added a new exception class :exc:`.CircuitToWideForTarget` which
    subclasses :exc:`.TranspilerError`. It's used in places where a
    :exc:`.TranspilerError` was previously raised when the error was that
    the number of circuit qubits was larger than the target backend's qubits.
    The new class enables more differentiating between this error condition and
    other :exc:`.TranspilerError`\s.
