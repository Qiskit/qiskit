    Fixed an issue when using :func:`.transpile` or running a preset pass
    manager (such as generated by :func:`.generate_preset_pass_manager`) when
    targeting a backend that has disjoint connectivity adding extra barriers
    to the output :class:`.QuantumCircuit`. In some cases several
    single qubit :class:`.Barrier` directives would be included in the output
    circuit right before any final measurements in the circuit. This was
    internal state generated by the internal processing for disjoint
    connectivity that was incorrectly being added into the output circuit.
    Fixed `#11649 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/11649>`__
