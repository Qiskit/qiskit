    The use of the (deprecated) ``Optimizer`` class on :class:`~.AQC` did not have a
    non-deprecated alternative path, which should have been introduced in
    the original ``qiskit-algorithms`` deprecation PR
    `#10406 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/pull/10406>`_.
    It now accepts a callable that implements the :class:`~.Minimizer` protocol,
    as explicitly stated in the deprecation warning. The callable can look like the
    following example:

      .. code-block:: python

          from functools import partial
          from scipy.optimize import minimize
          from qiskit.synthesis.unitary.aqc import AQC

          optimizer = partial(minimize, args=(), method="L-BFGS-B", options={"maxiter": 200})
          aqc = AQC(optimizer=optimizer)
