    Added a new exception class: :class:`.InvalidLayoutError`. This is a :class:`.TranspilerError`
    subclass which is raised when a user provided layout is invalid (mismatched size, duplicate
    qubits, etc).

fixes:
  - |
    Fixed an issue with the :class:`.SetLayout` transpiler pass where an invalid integer list input
    that contained duplicate entries which would result in an invalid :class:`.Layout` being
    generated and subsequent transpiler passes would fail with a cryptic error. This is now caught
    when :meth:`.SetLayout.run` is called an :class:`.InvalidLayoutError` error will be raised
    indicating there are duplicate entries in the integer list.
