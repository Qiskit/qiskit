    The :class:`.VF2Layout` and :class:`.VF2PostLayout` transpiler passes previously would
    potentially run their internal scoring using multithreading if the input
    circuit's were sufficiently large. However, the multithreading usage has
    been removed from the passes as it was shown to cause a performance
    regression instead of an improvement like originally intended.
