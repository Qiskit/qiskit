    The following deprecated functions previously in :mod:`qiskit.quantum_info`
    have been removed. These functions were marked as deprecated in the
    Qiskit 0.40.0 release, 2023-01.

      * ``decompose_clifford`` instead you should use the
        :func:`.qiskit.synthesis.synth_clifford_full` function.
      * ``decompose_cnotdihedral`` instead you should use the
        :func:`.qiskit.synthesis.synth_cnotdihedral_full` function.
