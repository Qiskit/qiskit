    :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.barrier` will now generate correct output when given a :class:`set` as
    one of its inputs.  Previously, it would append an invalid operation onto the circuit, though in
    practice this usually would not cause observable problems.
    Fixed `#11208 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/11208>`__
