    Fixed a bug in :class:`~.SabreLayout` where it would fail to add the layout
    register information to the property set. This affected circuit visualization, as
    ``circuit.draw()`` after transpilation with certain optimization levels would show
    the full ``Qubit[register]`` label rather than the expected register name
    (e.g. ``q0``).
