prelude: |
  We are very pleased to release Qiskit 1.0.0. This release is the
  culmination of 7 years of development to mature Qiskit into a stable high
  performance SDK to perform quantum computation, and is the start of new
  era for the Qiskit project and community. The most significant changes with the 1.0.0 
  release relate to the stability policy, release cycles, and versioning.
  Qiskit is now formally using `semantic versioning <https://semver.org/>`__ ,
  and this means that, for the entire lifecycle of the 1.x release series, the project
  is commited to maintaining backwards compatibility. We're also now starting
  to offer bugfix support for major versions, so that you continue to have a
  supported branch for 6 months after the release of the next major version.
  This starts now with the 1.x and 0.x major series: the 0.46.x release will
  continue to be supported, with bugfixes and periodic patch releases, for 6
  months after the release of 1.0. That is, 0.46.x will be supported until 2024-08. 
  You can see the full details of the new policy here:

  https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/start/install#qiskit-versioning

  Also of key importance in this release is the change in packaging. Since the
  Qiskit 0.7 release in 2018-12, when Qiskit introduced its
  `elements <https://medium.com/qiskit/qiskit-and-its-fundamental-elements-bcd7ead80492>`__
  model,  the ``qiskit`` package you would install has been a meta-package (or package of
  packages) that installs the combined elements comprising Qiskit. As announced
  in previous releases <link to 0.44, 0.45, and blog post>,  with the 1.0 release we're
  completing a transition to have a single ``qiskit`` package exposing only the
  core SDK (what was previously ``qiskit-terra``). This means that for releases >= 1.0.0,
  we have stopped using the ``qiskit-terra`` package and will only be publishing ``qiskit``.
  Unfortunately, this change in packaging structure is not something that
  can be fully communicated to ``pip``, the Python package installer. This
  means that it is not possible to just use ``pip install -U qiskit`` to upgrade
  from qiskit 0.46.0 to 1.0.0. It is strongly recommended that to upgrade to
  Qiskit 1.0.0 you create a seperate virtual environment to isolate the installation. There is a
  detailed migration guide that explains the packaging changes and how to install
  Qiskit 1.0.0 in different scenarios which can be found here:

  https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/migration-guides/qiskit-1.0

  As with all of our major releases, Qiskit 1.0.0 also has a plethora of new
  features, the highlights for this release are:

    * The :class:`.QuantumCircuit` class's internal :attr:`~.QuantumCircuit.data`
      structure has been rewritten in Rust to greatly improve the memory efficiency
      of the :class:`.QuantumCircuit` objects by caching the arguments of the
      instructions.

    * A new version of the primitives interface definition in :mod:`qiskit.primitives`
      with the :class:`.BaseSamplerV2` and :class:`.BaseEstimatorV2` abstract
      classes. This new version of the interface adds support for
      performing vectorized calls to the primitive so that sweeps over
      parameter value sets and observables can be efficiently specified.

    * A new experimental native OpenQASM 3 parser :func:`qiskit.qasm3.loads_experimental`
      and :func:`qiskit.qasm3.load_experimental`. This new parser is still under development
      and still has several limitations and is still experimental. However,
      for where it is usable, the new parser is significantly faster and has
      better diagnostic error message that allows to debug where an OpenQASM 3 program
      is invalid. This new parser is written in Rust and based on a newly developed
      Rust library for parsing OpenQASM3 which can be found here:
      https://github.com/Qiskit/openqasm3_parser

  Finally, the Qiskit 1.0.0 release was an opportunity to clean up some technical debt
  accumulated over the past 7 years of development. You'll notice that the Qiskit 1.0.0
  release is virtually free of ``DeprecationWarning``\s being emitted, and, at the same time,
  the upgrade section of the 1.0.0 release notes is longer than usual. These are direct
  consequences of the technical debt cleanup. To help with the migration
  from 0.46.x to 1.0.0, besides the release notes, we have also published a
  dedicated migration guide which can be found here: **INSERT LINK** . This guide is meant to
  complement the release notes and have a targeted advice for how to migrate the API changes
  after the removal of the deprecated functionality from the 0.46.0 release.
