    The class :class:`~.TwoQubitWeylDecomposition` has been added to the public API in
    :mod:`qiskit.synthesis`.  This class allows to apply the Weyl decomposition of two-qubit
    unitaries.  If you were previously importing this while it was a non-public class in the
    now-removed ``qiskit.quantum_info.synthesis`` module, you should update your import paths.

    Removed the ``qiskit.quantum_info.synthesis`` module, which has been deprecated since the 0.46 release.
    The following objects have been moved to :mod:`qiskit.synthesis`:

    * :class:`~.OneQubitEulerDecomposer` has been moved to :mod:`qiskit.synthesis.one_qubit`
    * :class:`~.TwoQubitBasisDecomposer` has been moved to :mod:`qiskit.synthesis.two_qubits`
    * :class:`~.XXDecomposer` has been moved to :mod:`qiskit.synthesis.two_qubits`
    * :func:`~.two_qubit_cnot_decompose` has been moved to :mod:`qiskit.synthesis.two_qubits`

    This function was removed, since it has already been deprecated in the 0.46 release:
    * ``cnot_rxx_decompose``

    These functions were removed, since they have already been deprecated in a previous release:
    * ``decompose_clifford`` (use :func:`.synth_clifford_full` instead)
    * ``decompose_cnotdihedral`` (use :func:`.synth_cnotdihedral_full` instead)
