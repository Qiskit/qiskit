features:
  - |
    Added a new transpiler pass :class:`.FilterOpNodes` which is used to filter
    :class:`.DAGOpNode`\s in a :class:`.DAGCircuit`.
  - |
    Added a new keyword argument, ``label``, to the constructor on the
    :class:`.BarrierBeforeFinalMeasurements` transpiler pass. If specified the
    inserted barrier will be assigned the specified label. This also prevents
    the inserted barrier from being merged with any any other pre-existing
    adjacent barriers.
other:
  - |
    The preset pass managers used by :func:`.transpile` and returned with
    :class:`.generate_preset_pass_manager` will no longer insert barriers
    before final measurements in the output circuits.
