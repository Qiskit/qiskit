    A new warning class, :exc:`~.QPYLoadingDeprecatedFeatureWarning`, has been added to the QPY module.
    This class allows for deprecation warnings to surface even if the depreacted feature
    is in a variable point in the call stack, as is the case for many QPY loading functions that
    are called recursively.
