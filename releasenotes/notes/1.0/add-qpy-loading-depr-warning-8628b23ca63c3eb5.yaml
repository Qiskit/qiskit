    Added a new warning class, :exc:`~.QPYLoadingDeprecatedFeatureWarning`, to the QPY module.
    This class allows for deprecation warnings to surface even if the deprecated feature
    is accessed at a variable point in the call stack, as is the case for many QPY loading functions that
    are called recursively.
