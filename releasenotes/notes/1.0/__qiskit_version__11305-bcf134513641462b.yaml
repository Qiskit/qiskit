    The variable ``qiskit.__qiskit_version__`` is removed as it was deprecated since 
    Qiskit 0.44 (released in 2023-07).
    Instead, you should use ``qiskit.__version__``. The other packages listed in the
    former ``qiskit.__qiskit_version__`` have their own ``__version__`` module level dunder,
    as standard in PEP 8.
