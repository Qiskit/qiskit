    Previously two objects of type :class:`~.UnitaryGate` class were considered equal
    even when they had different global phases. This could lead to transpiler
    passes not maintaining the global phase and, in theory, to incorrect optimizations.
    This commit changes the :meth:`~.UnitaryGate.__eq__` method not to ignore the global
    phases in the comparison.
