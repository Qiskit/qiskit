    The implicit use of ``approximation_degree!=1.0`` by default in the
    :func:`~.generate_preset_pass_manager` function has been
    disabled.  The previous default could cause undue and unexpected approximations, especially in
    workloads involving Trotterization or similar runs of operations that are close, but decidedly
    not equal, to the identity.

    This change brings the inner pass-manager generation defaults in line with :func:`.transpile`,
    which was always the intention.  See `#8595 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/pull/8595>`__ for
    more detail.
