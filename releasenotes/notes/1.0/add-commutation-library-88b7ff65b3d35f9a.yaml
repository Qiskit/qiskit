    Adds a commutation library to the :class:`.CommutationChecker`. The commutation library stores all
    commutation relations of unparameterizable standard gates into a dictionary that allows for efficient
    lookup at runtime. Furthermore, the :class:`.CommutationChecker` was refactored and an upper limit was
    set to the number of cached commutation relations that are not in the commutation library. A session
    commutation checker was added, that can be used to cache commutations computed during one qiskit
    execution. Addresses `#8020 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/8020>_` and
    `#7101 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/7101>_`

    Adds a `SessionCommutationChecker`, i.e. a commutation checker with commutations that are cached
    consistently during the runtime of a python execution.
