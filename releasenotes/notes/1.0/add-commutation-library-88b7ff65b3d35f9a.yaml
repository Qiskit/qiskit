    Added a commutation library to the :class:`.CommutationChecker` which stores all the
    commutation relations of unparameterizable standard gates into a dictionary that allows
    for efficient lookup at runtime. This speeds up the execution of the :class:`.CommutationChecker`
    class and by extensions the :class:`.CommutationAnalysis` transpiler pass as instead of
    computing whether two unparameterizable standard gates commute it just has to look it up
    from the library.

    Additionally, the :class:`.CommutationChecker` was refactored and now has an upper limit
    set on the number of cached commutation relations that are not in the commutation library.
    This addressed: `#8020 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/8020>`__ and
