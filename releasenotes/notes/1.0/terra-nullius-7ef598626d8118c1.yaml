    You cannot upgrade in place to Qiskit 1.0.  You must begin a new virtual environment.

    From Qiskit 1.0, Qiskit is comprised of exactly one Python package: ``qiskit``.  Previously,
    as a legacy of the "component elements" of early Qiskit, the ``qiskit`` package was a
    dependency-only "metapackage", and the core code of Qiskit was in a package called ``qiskit-terra``.
    As Qiskit grew, the other elements split off into their own packages (such as ``qiskit-aer``)
    until only the core was left in the metapackage.  For Qiskit 1.0, we are removing the metapackage
    entirely, and replacing it with the actual Qiskit code.

    This means that you cannot upgrade an existing installation to Qiskit 1.0.  Instead, you must
    create a new Python virtual environment.  Using the built-in ``venv`` module, you can do (Linux
    and Mac):

    .. code-block:: bash

      # Create the new environment (only once).
      python -m venv ~/qiskit-1.0-venv
      # Activate the environment (every session).
      source ~/qiskit-1.0-venv/bin/activate
      # Install Qiskit (only once).
      pip install 'qiskit>=1.0'

    For other platforms, or more unusual shells, refer to `the Python standard-library documentation
    on activating virtual environments <https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#how-venvs-work>`__.

    If you are a library author, or have code that depends on Qiskit, you should update any old
    dependencies on ``qiskit-terra`` to instead depend on ``qiskit``.
