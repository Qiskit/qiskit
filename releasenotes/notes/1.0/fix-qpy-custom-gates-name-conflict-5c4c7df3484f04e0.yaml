    The latest format version of QPY is now :ref:`qpy_version_11` and this
    is what is emitted by default when running :func:`.qpy.dump`.
fixes:
  - |
    Fixed an issue with the QPY serialization when a :class:`.QuantumCircuit`
    contained multiple custom instructions instances that have the same
    :attr:`~.Instruction.name` attribute. In QPY format versions before
    :ref:`qpy_version_11` the QPY payload did not differentiate between
    these instances and would only serialize the properties of the first
    instance in a circuit. This could potentially cause an incorrect
    deserialization if the other properties of the custom instruction were
    different but the names were the same. This has been fixed in
    QPY :ref:`qpy_version_11` so that each instance of a custom instruction
    is serialized individually and there will no longer be a potential
    conflict with overlapping names.
    Fixes `#8941 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/8941>`__.
