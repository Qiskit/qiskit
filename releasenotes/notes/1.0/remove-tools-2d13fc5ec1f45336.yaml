    The deprecated ``qiskit.tools.visualization`` module has removed. This module
    was deprecated in the Qiskit 0.46.0 release. This module was a legacy redirect
    from the original location of Qiskit's visualization module and was moved to
    :mod:`qiskit.visualization` in Qiskit 0.8.0. If you're still using this path
    you can just update your imports from ``qiskit.tools.visualization``
    to :mod:`qiskit.visualization`.

    The deprecated ``qiskit.tools.events`` module and the corresponding
    ``qiskit.tools.progressbar`` utility it exposed has been removed. It was deprecated
    in the Qiskit 0.46.0 release. This module's functionality was not widely used and
    better covered by dedicated packages such as `tqdm <https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm>`__.

    The ``qiskit.tools`` module has been removed. This module was deprecated in Qiskit 0.46.0.
    All the contents from this module have been removed except for the ``qiskit.tools.parallel_map``
    function which now can be used from :func:`qiskit.utils.parallel_map` instead.
