    Fixed an issue in the :class:`.SabreSwap` and :class:`.SabreLayout`
    transpiler passes where they would incorrectly treat 2-qubit
    :class:`.Barrier` instructions as an instruction that needs to be
    routed according the transpiler :class:`.Target`. When this occurred the
    output was still correct but would potentially include unnecessary
    :class:`.SwapGate` instructions.
