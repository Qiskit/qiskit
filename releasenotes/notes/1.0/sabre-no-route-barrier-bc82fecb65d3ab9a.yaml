    Fixed an issue in the :class:`.SabreSwap` and :class:`.SabreLayout`
    transpiler passes where it would incorrectly treat 2 qubit
    :class:`.Barrier` instructions as an instruction that needs to be
    routed according the transpiler :class:`.Target`. When this occured the
    output was still correct but would potentially include unecessary
    :class:`.SwapGate` instructions.
