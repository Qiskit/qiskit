    Changed default value of two arguments :code:`add_delay` and :code:`filter_faulty` in
    the :func:`.qiskit.providers.backend_compat.convert_to_target`.
    Now this conversion function adds delay instruction and removes faulty instructions by default.

    Fixes return of improper measurement schedule that may occur in the following program:

    .. code-block:: python

      # import a fake backend which is a sub-class of BackendV2.
      from qiskit.providers.fake_provider import FakePerth
      backend = FakePerth()
      sched = backend.instruction_schedule_map.get('measure', [0])

    This unexpectedly returned a measure schedule including all device qubits,
    which was fixed in this release.
    Now this returns a schedule for qubit 0 as intended.
