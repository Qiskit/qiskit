    Changed default value of two arguments (:code:`add_delay` and :code:`filter_faulty`) in
    the :func:`.qiskit.providers.backend_compat.convert_to_target` function.
    This conversion function now adds delay instructions and removes faulty instructions by default.
fixes:
  - |
    Fixed the return of improper measurement schedules in examples like the following:

    .. code-block:: python

      # import a fake backend which is a sub-class of BackendV2.
      from qiskit.providers.fake_provider import FakePerth
      backend = FakePerth()
      sched = backend.instruction_schedule_map.get('measure', [0])

    This unexpectedly returned a measure schedule including all device qubits, when only one was requested.
    Now this code returns a schedule for qubit 0 as intended.
