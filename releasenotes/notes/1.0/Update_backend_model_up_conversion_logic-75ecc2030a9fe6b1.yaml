    Changed default value of two arguments (:code:`add_delay` and :code:`filter_faulty`) in
    the :func:`.convert_to_target` function.
    This conversion function now adds delay instructions and removes faulty instructions by default.

    Fixed the return of improper measurement schedules when only a subset of qubits was requested.
    Previously, a measurement schedule for all qubits would be returned.
