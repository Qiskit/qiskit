    Added a new :class:`~.BaseEstimatorV2` primitive base class based on
    `the RFC <https://github.com/Qiskit/RFCs/blob/master/0015-estimator-interface.md>`_.
    This base class establishes the new ``EstimatorV2`` interface, which adds support for
    performing vectorized calls so that sweeps over parameter value sets and observables
    can be efficiently specified.
