    Fixed an error when a user tries to load calibration
    data of a gate from a :class:`.Target` in a particular situation.
    This occurs when the backend reports only partial calibration data, for
    example referencing a waveform pulse in a command definition but not
    including that waveform pulse in the pulse library. In this situation, the
    Qiskit pulse object could not be built, resulting in a failure to build the pulse
    schedule for the calibration. Now when calibration data is incomplete
    the :class:`.Target` treats it as equivalent to no calibration being reported
    at all and does not raise an exception.
