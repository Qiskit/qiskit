    Added two new arguments ``matrix_based`` and ``max_qubits`` to the
    constructor of :class:`.CommutativeInverseCancellation` transpiler pass.
    When ``matrix_based`` is ``True`` the pass uses matrix representations to
    check whether two operations are inverse of each other. This makes the
    checks more powerful, and in addition allows canceling pairs of operations
    that are inverse up to a phase, while updating the global phase of the circuit
    accordingly. Generally this leads to more reductions at the expense of increased
    runtime. The argument ``max_qubits`` limits the number of qubits in matrix-based
    commutativity and inverse checks. For example::

        import numpy as np
        from qiskit.circuit import QuantumCircuit
        from qiskit.transpiler import PassManager
        from qiskit.transpiler.passes import CommutativeInverseCancellation

        circuit = QuantumCircuit(1)
        circuit.rz(np.pi / 4, 0)
        circuit.p(-np.pi / 4, 0)

        passmanager = PassManager(CommutativeInverseCancellation(matrix_based=True))
        new_circuit = passmanager.run(circuit)

    The pass is able to cancel the ``RZ`` and ``P`` gates, while adjusting the circuit's global
    phase to :math:`\frac{15 \pi}{8}`.
