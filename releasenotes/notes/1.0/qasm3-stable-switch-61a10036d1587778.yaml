    The OpenQASM 3 exporter (see :func:`~.qasm3.dump` and :func:`~.qasm3.dumps` functions in
    :mod:`qiskit.qasm3`) now supports the stabilized syntax of the ``switch`` statement in OpenQASM 3
    by default.  The pre-certification syntax of the ``switch`` statement is still available by
    using the :attr:`.ExperimentalFeatures.SWITCH_CASE_V1` flag in the ``experimental`` argument of
    the exporter.  There is no feature flag required for the stabilized syntax, but if you are
    interfacing with other tooling that is not yet updated, you may need to pass the experimental
    flag.

    The syntax of the stabilized form is slightly different with regards to terminating ``break``
    statements (no longer required nor permitted), and multiple cases are now combined into a single
    ``case`` line, rather than using C-style fall-through.  For more detail, see `the OpenQASM 3
    documentation on the switch-case construct
    <https://openqasm.com/language/classical.html#the-switch-statement>`__.
