    Added a new transpiler pass, :class:`.OptimizeAnnotated` that optimizes annotated
    operations on a quantum circuit.

    Consider the following example::

      from qiskit.circuit import QuantumCircuit
      from qiskit.circuit.annotated_operation import (
          AnnotatedOperation,
          InverseModifier,
          ControlModifier,
      )
      from qiskit.circuit.library import CXGate, SwapGate
      from qiskit.transpiler.passes import OptimizeAnnotated

      # Create a quantum circuit with multiple annotated gates
      gate1 = AnnotatedOperation(
          SwapGate(),
          [InverseModifier(), ControlModifier(2), InverseModifier(), ControlModifier(1)],
      )
      gate2 = AnnotatedOperation(
          SwapGate(),
          [InverseModifier(), InverseModifier()]
      )
      gate3 = AnnotatedOperation(
          AnnotatedOperation(CXGate(), ControlModifier(2)),
          ControlModifier(1)
      )
      qc = QuantumCircuit(6)
      qc.append(gate1, [3, 2, 4, 0, 5])
      qc.append(gate2, [1, 5])
      qc.append(gate3, [5, 4, 3, 2, 1])

      # Optimize the circuit using OptimizeAnnotated transpiler pass
      qc_optimized = OptimizeAnnotated()(qc)

      # This is how the optimized circuit should look like
      gate1_expected = AnnotatedOperation(SwapGate(), ControlModifier(3))
      gate2_expected = SwapGate()
      gate3_expected = AnnotatedOperation(CXGate(), ControlModifier(3))
      qc_expected = QuantumCircuit(6)
      qc_expected.append(gate1_expected, [3, 2, 4, 0, 5])
      qc_expected.append(gate2_expected, [1, 5])
      qc_expected.append(gate3_expected, [5, 4, 3, 2, 1])

      assert qc_optimized == qc_expected

    In the case of ``gate1``, the modifiers of the annotated swap gate are brought
    into the canonical form: the two :class:`.InverseModifier`\s cancel out, and the two
    :class:`.ControlModifier`\s are combined. In the case of ``gate2``, all the modifiers
    get removed and the annotated operation is replaced by its base operation.
    In the case of ``gate3``, multiple layers of annotations are combined into one.

    The constructor of :class:`.OptimizeAnnotated` pass accepts optional
    arguments ``target``, ``equivalence_library``,  ``basis_gates`` and ``recurse``.
    When ``recurse`` is ``True`` (the default value) and when either ``target``
    or ``basis_gates`` are specified, the pass recursively descends into the gates
    ``definition`` circuits, with the exception of gates that are already supported
    by the target or that belong to the equivalence library. On the other hand, when
    neither ``target`` nor ``basis_gates`` are specified,
    or when ``recurse`` is set to ``False``,
    the pass synthesizes only the "top-level" annotated operations, i.e. does not
    recursively descend into the ``definition`` circuits. This behavior is consistent
    with that of :class:`.HighLevelSynthesis` transpiler pass that needs to be called
    in order to "unroll" the annotated operations into 1-qubit and 2-qubits gates.
