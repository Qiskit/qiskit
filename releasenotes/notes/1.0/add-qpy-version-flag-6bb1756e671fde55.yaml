    Added a new flag, ``version``, to the :func:`.qpy.dump` function. This allows
    :func:`.qpy.dump` to optionally take an integer value for the :ref:`qpy_format`
    version to emit. This is useful if you need to generate a QPY
    file that will be loaded by an older version of Qiskit. However, the
    supported versions to emit are limited, only versions between the latest
    QPY version (which is the default), and the compatibility QPY version
    which is :ref:`qpy_version_10` (which was introduced in Qiskit 0.45.0) can
    be used. The compatibility version will remain fixed for the entire
    1.x.y major version release series. This does not change the backwards
    compatibility guarantees of the QPY format when calling :func:`.qpy.load`,
    it just enables users to emit an older version of QPY to maintain
    compatibility and interoperability between the 0.x and 1.x release series.
