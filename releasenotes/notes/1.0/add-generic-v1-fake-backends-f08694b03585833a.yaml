    The :mod:`qiskit.providers.fake_provider` module now includes a series of generic fake backends
    following the :class:`.BackendV1` interface. They have been introduced as an alternative to the
    snapshot-based fake backends exposed in the deprecated ``FakeProvider``
    (``FakeVigo``, ``FakeTokyo``, etc). The list of new fake backends includes:

      * Backends without pulse capabilities:
        * :class:`.Fake5QV1`
        * :class:`.Fake20QV1`

      * Backends with pulse capabilities:
        * :class:`.Fake7QPulseV1`
        * :class:`.Fake27QPulseV1`
        * :class:`.Fake127QPulseV1`

    The can be imported following the pattern: ``from qiskit.providers.fake_provider import Fake5QV1``.
    More details on the backend properties can be found on each backend's API documentation.
