    The :func:`.dag_drawer` has been updated for the :class:`.DAGDependency`. These
    drawings have a new color scheme, and the nodes now indicate the ``Qubits`` and
    ``Clbits`` that are used by the node. If the node has a ``condition`` the drawings
    will indicate that as well.

          from qiskit.circuit import QuantumCircuit
          from qiskit.converters import circuit_to_dagdependency
