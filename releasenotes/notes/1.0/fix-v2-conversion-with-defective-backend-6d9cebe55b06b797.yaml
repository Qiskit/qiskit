fixes:
  - |
    A bug where :func:`.convert_to_target` of :class:`.BackendV2Converter` raised an unexpected
    error was solved. The bug occured when the backend to convert included calibrations
    for a gate that didn't have a definition in the backend properties.
    Such gate is now broadcasted to all qubits as an ideal error-free instruction,
    even when calibrations for a finite set of qubits are reported.
upgrade:
  - |
    Updated information of :class:`.FakeOpenPulse2Q` backend, including properties, defaults and 
    previously missing instructions.
