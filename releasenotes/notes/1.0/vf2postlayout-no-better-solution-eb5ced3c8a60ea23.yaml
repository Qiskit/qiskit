    :class:`.VF2PostLayout` now distinguishes between 'no solution' and 'no better solution' when
    determining a :class:`.Layout` for a given quantum circuit. 'no better solution' is set when the
    initial layout of a quantum circuit is also the optimal one, i.e. incurs the least cost in terms of
    error rates.
