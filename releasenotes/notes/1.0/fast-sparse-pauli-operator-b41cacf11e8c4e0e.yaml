    :meth:`.SparsePauliOp.from_operator` now uses an implementation of the
    "tensorized Pauli decomposition algorithm" presented in
    `Hatznko, Binkowski and Gupta (2023) <https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13421>`__.  The method is now
    several orders of magnitude faster; for example, it is possible to decompose a random
    10-qubit operator in around 250ms on a consumer Macbook Pro (Intel i7, 2020).
