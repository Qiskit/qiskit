    The class :class:`.EvolvedOperatorAnsatz` has been migrated from
    :mod:`qiskit.circuit.library` to :mod:`qiskit.circuit.library.n_local` to match
    the location of its base class. This move has not affected the usual import path
    of the class: ``from qiskit.circuit.library import EvolvedOperatorAnsatz``, but
    now it is also accessible doing ``from qiskit.circuit.library.n_local import
    EvolvedOperatorAnsatz``.
