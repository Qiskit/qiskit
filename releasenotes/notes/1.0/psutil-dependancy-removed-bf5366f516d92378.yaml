    The dependency on `psutil <https://pypi.org/project/psutil/>`__ has been removed. The
    psutil library was previously only used for detecting the number of physical CPUs and
    total system memory, however this information provided does not add sufficient value
    to justify the additional dependencies and overhead so it has been removed. This does
    mean that the default number of processes used by :func:`.parallel_map` and functions that
    internally can use :func:`.parallel_map` such as :func:`.transpile` and :meth:`.PassManager.run`
    may use more or less parallel processes than in previous releases. If you'd like to adjust the
    number of processes used you can use the ``QISKIT_NUM_PROCS`` environment variable or
    ``num_processes`` field in a user configuration file (see the
    `local configuration guide <https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/start/configure-qiskit-local>`__
    for more details) if you need to adjust the number of processes that Qiskit potentially uses.
