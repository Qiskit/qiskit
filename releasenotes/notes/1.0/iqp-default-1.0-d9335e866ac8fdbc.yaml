upgrade_visualization:
  - |
    The default style for the circuit visualization using Matplotlib has been
    changed to ``"iqp"``, matching the IBM Quantum Platform.
  - |
    The deprecated module ``qiskit.visualization.qcstyle`` has been removed.
    This module has been marked as deprecated since Qiskit 0.39.0. Instead you
    should use the :mod:`qiskit.visualization.circuit.qcstyle`.
