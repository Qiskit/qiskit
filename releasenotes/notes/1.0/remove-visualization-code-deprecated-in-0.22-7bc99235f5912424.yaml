    The deprecated support for passing a :class:`.QuasiDistribution`,
    :class:`.ProbDistribution`, or a distribution dictionary to the ``data``
    argument of the :func:`.plot_histogram` visualization has been removed.
    This functionality was marked as deprecated in the Qiskit 0.39.0 release
    (2022-10). Instead if you would like to plot a histogram from a
    :class:`.QuasiDistribution`, :class:`.ProbDistribution`, or a distribution
    dictionary you should use the :func:`.plot_distribution` function
    instead.
