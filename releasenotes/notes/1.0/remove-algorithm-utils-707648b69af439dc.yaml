    The following tools in :mod:`qiskit.utils` have been removed from the codebase:

    * Utils in ``qiskit.utils.arithmetic``
    * Utils in ``qiskit.utils.circuit_utils``
    * Utils in ``qiskit.utils.entangler_map``
    * Utils in ``qiskit.utils.name_unnamed_args``

    These functions were used exclusively in the context of ``qiskit.algorithms`` and
    ``qiskit.opflow``, and were deprecated in Qiskit 0.46. ``qiskit.algorithms`` and
    ``qiskit.opflow`` have been deprecated since Qiskit 0.45 and Qiskit Terra 0.24
    respectively.

    The following utilities have also been removed:

    * Utils in ``qiskit.utils.validation``
    * ``algorithm_globals``

    These were deprecated in Qiskit 0.45 as a consequence of the migration
    of ``qiskit.algorithms`` to `a standalone package
    <https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-algorithms>`_, where
    these utilities have also been migrated. They can be found in the new package
    under ``qiskit_algorithms.utils``.
