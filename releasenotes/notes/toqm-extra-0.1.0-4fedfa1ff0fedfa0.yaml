    Optional feature package ``toqm`` installable via
    ``pip install qiskit-terra[toqm]`` has been upgraded from version
    ``0.0.4`` to ``0.1.0``. To use the ``toqm`` routing method
    with :meth:`~.transpile` you must now use qiskit-toqm version
    ``0.1.0`` or newer. Older versions are no longer discoverable by
    the transpiler.
