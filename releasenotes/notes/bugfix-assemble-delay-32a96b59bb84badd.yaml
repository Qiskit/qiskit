    Pulse :py:class:`~qiskit.pulse.instructions.Delay` is now explicitly
    assembled as qobj instructions.

    Previously, we could ignore delays rather than assembling them. Now, with
    pulse gates, there are times that we want to schedule ONLY a delay, and not
    including the delay itself would remove the delay.
