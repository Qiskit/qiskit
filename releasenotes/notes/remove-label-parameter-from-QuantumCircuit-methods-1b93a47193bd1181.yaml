    Previously, there exists some discrepancy between gate methods in 
    ``qiskit.QuantumCircuit`` module. Some gate methods, (for example: cx) 
    accept labal parameter while others (for example: ccx()) don't.
    This discrepancy is addressed by removing label parameter from all gate 
    methods in ``qiskit.QuantumCircuit`` module. Refer to 
    `#5098 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/5098>` for more details.

    Gate methods that are affected:
    control, ch, cp, rx, crx, ry, cry, crz, cswap, csx, cu, cu1, cu3, 
    x, cx, cnot, cy, cz
