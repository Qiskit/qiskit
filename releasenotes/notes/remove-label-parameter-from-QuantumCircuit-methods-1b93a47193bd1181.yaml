    Previously, there exists some discrepancy between gate methods in 
    ``qiskit.QuantumCircuit`` module. Some gate methods (for example: cx) 
    accept ``label`` parameter while others (for example: ccx) don't.
    This discrepancy is addressed by removing the ``label`` parameter 
    from all gate methods in ``qiskit.QuantumCircuit`` module. 
    If a label is required, you can use ``.append()`` notation 
    to add the gate to your circuit. 
    For example::
      
      from qiskit import QuantumCircuit

      circ = QuantumCircuit(2)
      circ.append(XGate(label="label"),[0],[])

    Refer to `#5098 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/5098>` 
    for more details.
    
    Gate methods that are affected:
    control, ch, cp, rx, crx, ry, cry, crz, cswap, csx, cu, cu1, cu3, 
    x, cx, cnot, cy, cz
