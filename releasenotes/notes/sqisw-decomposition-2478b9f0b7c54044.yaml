    Added a new gate to the standard_gates library :class:`.SQiSWGate`
    to represent the square-root of an iSWAP. This gate has the desirable
    properties of being faster/higher-fidelity than a full iSWAP, but also
    synthesizing the volume of two-qubit unitaries with fewer applications.

    An associated decomposition method that synthesizes arbitrary two-qubit
    unitaries into two or three applications of SQiSW has been added in
    :class:`.SQiSWDecomposer`.
