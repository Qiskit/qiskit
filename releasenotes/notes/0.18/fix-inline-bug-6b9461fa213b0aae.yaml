fixes:
  - |
    Fixed an issue with the :func:`qiskit.pulse.transforms.inline_subroutines`
    function which would previously incorrectly not remove all the nested
    components when called on nested schedules.
    Fixed `#6321 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/6321>`__
features:
  - |
    A new method :meth:`~qiskit.pulse.Schedule.children` for the
    :class:`~qiskit.pulse.Schedule` class has been added. This method is used
    to return the child schedule components of the
    :class:`~qiskit.pulse.Schedule` object as a tuple. It returns nested
    schedules without flattening. This method is equivalent to the private
    ``_children()`` method but has a public and stable interface.
