    The legacy providers interface, which consisted of the
    :class:`qiskit.providers.BaseBackend`, :class:`qiskit.providers.BaseJob`,
    and :class:`qiskit.providers.BaseProvider` abstract classes, has been
    deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Instead you should use
    the versioned interface, which the current abstract class versions are
    :class:`qiskit.providers.BackendV1`, :class:`qiskit.providers.JobV1`, and
    :class:`qiskit.providers.ProviderV1`. The V1 objects are mostly backwards
    compatible to ease migration from the legacy interface to the versioned
    one. However, expect future versions of the abstract interfaces to diverge
    more. You can refer to the :mod:`qiskit.providers` documentation for
    more high level details about the versioned interface.
