    Fixed an issue with the
    :meth:`~qiskit.opflow.expectations.PauliExpectation.convert` method of
    the :class:`~qiskit.opflow.expectations.PauliExpectation` class where
    calling it on an operator that was non-Hermitian would return
    an incorrect result.
    Fixed `#6307 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/6307>`__
