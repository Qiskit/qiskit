features:
  - |
    Added two new methods, :meth:`~qiskit.dagcircuit.DAGCircuit.is_successor` and
    :meth:`~qiskit.dagcircuit.DAGCircuit.is_predecessor`, to the
    :class:`~qiskit.dagcircuit.DAGCircuit` class. These functions are used to check if a node
    is either a successor or predecessor of another node on the :class:`~qiskit.dagcircuit.DAGCircuit`.
upgrade:
  - |
    The minimum version of the `retworkx <https://pypi.org/project/retworkx/>`_ dependency
    was increased to version `0.9.0`. This was done to use new APIs introduced in that release
    which improved the performance of some transpiler passes.
