    The deprecation of the :meth:`~qiskit.pulse.Instruction.parameters` method
    for the :class:`~qiskit.pulse.Instruction` class has been reversed. This
    method was originally deprecated in the 0.17.0, but it is still necessary
    for several applications, including when running calibration experiments.
    This method will continue to be supported and will **not** be removed.
