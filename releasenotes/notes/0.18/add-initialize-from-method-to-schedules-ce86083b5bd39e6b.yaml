    A new constructor method
    :meth:`~qiskit.pulse.Schedule.initialize_from` was added to the
    :class:`~qiskit.pulse.Schedule` and :class:`~qiskit.pulse.ScheduleBlock`
    classes. This method initializes a new empty schedule which
    takes the attributes from other schedule. For example:

    .. code-block:: python

        sched = Schedule(name='my_sched')
        new_sched = Schedule.initialize_from(sched)

        assert sched.name == new_sched.name
