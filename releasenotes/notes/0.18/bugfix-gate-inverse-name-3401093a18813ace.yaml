    Fixed an issue in assigning the :attr:`~qiskit.circuit.Gate.name`
    attribute when the :meth:`~qiskit.circuit.Gate.inverse`` method of
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.Gate` on multiple calls. Prior to this fix
    when the :meth:`~qiskit.circuit.Gate.inverse`` was called it would
    unconditionally append ``_dg`` on each call to inverse. This has
    been corrected so on a second call of
    :meth:`~qiskit.circuit.Gate.inverse`` the ``_dg`` suffix is now removed.
