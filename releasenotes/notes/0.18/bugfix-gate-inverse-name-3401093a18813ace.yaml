    Fixed bug in assigning name attribute to ``inverse()`` function of 
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.Gate` (inherited from :class:`~qiskit.circuit.Instruction`).
    Earlier, the inverse() function returned a gate with label None. Now 
    the label of inverse is built using the label calling it.
    `#6563 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/pull/6563>` for more details.
