    Fixed an issue in the assignment of the :attr:`~qiskit.circuit.Gate.name`
    attribute to :class:`~qiskit.circuit.Gate` generated by multiple calls to
    the :meth:`~qiskit.circuit.Gate.inverse`` method. Prior to this fix
    when the :meth:`~qiskit.circuit.Gate.inverse`` was called it would
    unconditionally append ``_dg`` on each call to inverse. This has
    been corrected so on a second call of
    :meth:`~qiskit.circuit.Gate.inverse`` the ``_dg`` suffix is now removed.
