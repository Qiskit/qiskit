    Fixed an issue with the :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.PiecewiseChebyshev`
    when setting the
    :attr:`~qiskit.circuit.library.PiecewiseChebyshev.breakpoints` to ``None``
    on an existing object was incorrectly being treated as a breakpoint. This
    has been corrected so that when it is set to ``None`` this will switch back
    to the default  behavior of approximating over the full interval.
    Fixed `#6198 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/6198>`__
