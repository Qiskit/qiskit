    The RZXCalibrationBuilderNoEcho creates calibrations for RZXGate(theta) without 
    inserting the echo pulses in the pulse schedule. This enables exposing the echo in
    the cross-resonance sequence as gates so that the transpiler can simplify them.
    The RZXCalibrationBuilderNoEcho only supports the hardware-native direction
    of the CX gate.
