    The abstract ``Pulse`` class (which is the parent class for classes such
    as :class:`~qiskit.pulse.library.Waveform`,
    :class:`~qiskit.pulse.library.Constant`, and
    :class:`~qiskit.pulse.library.Gaussian` now has a new kwarg on the
    constructor, ``limit_amplitude``, which can be set to ``False`` to disable
    the previously hard coded amplitude limit of ``1``. This can also be set as
    a class attribute directly to change the global default for a Pulse class.
    For example::

      from qiskit.pulse.library import Waveform

      # Change the default value of limit_amplitude to False
      Waveform.limit_amplitude = False
      wave = Waveform(2.0 * np.exp(1j * 2 * np.pi * np.linspace(0, 1, 1000)))
