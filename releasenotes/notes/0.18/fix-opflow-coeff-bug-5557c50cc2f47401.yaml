    Fix a bug in Opflow's expectation converters, where coefficient of a statefunction
    have not been multiplied correctly. This also fixes the calculations of Gradients and
    QFIs with :class:`~qiskit.opflow.PauliExpectation` and
    :class:`~qiskit.opflow.AerPauliExpectation`.

    For example, previously

    .. code-block::python

        from qiskit.opflow import StateFn, I, One

        exp = ~StateFn(I) @ (2 * One)

    evaluated to 2 for :class:`~qiskit.opflow.AerPauliExpectation` and to 4 for other
    expectation converters. Since ``~StateFn(I) @ (2 * One)`` is a shorthand notation for
    ``~(2 * One) @ I @ (2 * One)``, the now correct coefficient for all expectation converters
    is 4.
