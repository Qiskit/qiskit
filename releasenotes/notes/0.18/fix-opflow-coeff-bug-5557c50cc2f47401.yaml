    Fixed an issue with the :mod:`qiskit.opflow.expectations` module
    where coefficients of a statefunction were not being multiplied correctly.
    This also fixed the calculations
    of Gradients and QFIs when using the
    :class:`~qiskit.opflow.expectations.PauliExpectation` or
    :class:`~qiskit.opflow.expectations.AerPauliExpectation` classes. For
    example, previously::

        from qiskit.opflow import StateFn, I, One

        exp = ~StateFn(I) @ (2 * One)

    evaluated to ``2``
    for :class:`~qiskit.opflow.expectations.AerPauliExpectation` and to ``4``
    for other expectation converters. Since ``~StateFn(I) @ (2 * One)`` is a
    shorthand notation for ``~(2 * One) @ I @ (2 * One)``, the now correct
    coefficient of ``4`` is returned for all expectation converters.
    Fixed `#6497 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/6497>`__
