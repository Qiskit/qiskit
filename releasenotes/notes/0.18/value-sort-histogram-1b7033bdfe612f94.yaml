    Two new options, ``'value'`` and ``'value_desc'`` were added to the
    ``sort`` kwarg of the :func:`qiskit.visualization.plot_histogram` function.
    When ``sort`` is set to either of these options the output visualization
    will sort the x axis based on the maximum probability for each bitstring.
    For example:

    .. jupyter-execute::

      from qiskit.visualization import plot_histogram

      counts = {
        '000': 5,
        '001': 25,
        '010': 125,
        '011': 625,
        '100': 3125,
        '101': 15625,
        '110': 78125,
        '111': 390625,
      }
      plot_histogram(counts, sort='value')
