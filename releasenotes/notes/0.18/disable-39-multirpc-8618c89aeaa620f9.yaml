issues:

    When running :func:`~qiskit.tools.parallel_map` (and functions that
    internally call :func:`~qiskit.tools.parallel_map` such as
    :func:`~qiskit.compiler.transpile` and :func:`~qiskit.compiler.assemble`)
    on Python 3.9 with ``QISKIT_PARALLEL`` set to True in some scenarios it is
    possible for the program to deadlock and never finish running. To avoid
    this from happening the default for Python 3.9 was changed to not run in
    parallel, but if ``QISKIT_PARALLEL`` is explicitly enabled then this
    can still occur.
upgrade:
  - |
    The default value for ``QISKIT_PARALLEL`` on Python 3.9 environments has
    changed to ``False``, this means that when running on Python 3.9 by default
    multiprocessing will not be used. This was done to avoid a potential
    deadlock/hanging issue that can occur when running multiprocessing on
    Python 3.9 (see the known issues section for more detail). It is still
    possible to manual enable it by explicitly setting the ``QISKIT_PARALLEL``
    environment variable to ``TRUE``.
