    Fixed an issue with the initialization of the
    :class:`~qiskit.algorithms.AmplificationProblem` class. The
    ``is_good_state`` kwarg was a required field but incorrectly being treated
    as optional (and documented as such). This has been fixed and also
    updated so unless the input ``oracle`` is a
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.PhaseOracle` object (which provides it's
    on evaluation method) the field is required and will raise a ``TypeError``
    when constructed without ``is_good_state``.
