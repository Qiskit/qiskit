    Fixed an issue in the :meth:`qiskit.opflow.gradients.Gradient.gradient_wrapper`
    method with the gradient calculation. Previously, if the operator was
    not diagonal an incorrect result would be returned in some situations.
    This has been fixed by using an expectation converter to ensure the
    result is always correct.
