    Fixed an issue with the
    :class:`~qiskit.transpiler.passes.OptimizeSwapBeforeMeasure` transpiler pass
    where in some situations a :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.SwapGate`
    that that contained a classical condition would be removed.
    Fixed `#6192 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/6192>`__
