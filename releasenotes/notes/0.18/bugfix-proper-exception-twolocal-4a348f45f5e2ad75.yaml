    Fixed an issue with the :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.NLocal` class
    in the :mod:`qiskit.circuit.library` module where it wouldn't properly
    raise an exception at object initialization if an invalid type was
    used for the ``reps`` kwarg which would result in an unexpected runtime
    error later. A ``TypeError`` will now be properly raised if the ``reps``
    kwarg is not an ``int`` value.
    Fixed `#6515 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/6515>`__
