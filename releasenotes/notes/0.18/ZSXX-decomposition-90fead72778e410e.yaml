features:
  - |
    The decomposition methods for single-qubit gates, specified via the
    ``basis`` kwarg, in
    :class:`~qiskit.quantum_info.OneQubitEulerDecomposer` has been expanded to
    now also include the ``'ZSXX'`` basis, for making use of direct
    :math:`X` gate as well as :math:`\sqrt{X}` gate.
fixes:
  - |
    The :class:`~qiskit.quantum_info.OneQubitEulerDecomposer` and
    :class:`~qiskit.quantum_info.TwoQubitBasisDecomposer` classes for
    one and two qubit gate synthesis have been improved to tighten up
    tolerances, improved repeatability and simplification, and fix
    several global-phase-tracking bugs.
