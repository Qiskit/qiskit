    Fixed an issue with the :func:`~qiskit.visualization.circuit_drawer`
    function and :meth:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.draw` method of
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit` when the ``reverse_bits`` kwarg
    was set to ``True`` in some situations the lines from conditional gates
    or measurements to intersect with other gates or circuit elements.

    function and :meth:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.draw` method of
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit` when using the ``mpl`` or ``latex``
    output modes and ``cregbundle`` kwarg was set to ``False`` with the
    ``reverse_bits`` kwarg set to ``True`` the bits in the classical registers
    displayed in the same order as when ``reverse_bits`` was set to ``False``.
