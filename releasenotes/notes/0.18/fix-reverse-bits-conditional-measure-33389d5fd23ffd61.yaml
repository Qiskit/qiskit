    This fixes a problem with all 3 circuit drawers - 'text', 'mpl', and 'latex',
    where whenever the ``reverse_bits`` kwarg to the ``draw`` command was set,
    it was possible for the lines from conditional gates or measures to run
    through another gate.

    This fixes a problem in the 'mpl' and 'latex' drawers where if the ``cregbundle``
    kwarg to the ``draw`` command was False and the ``reverse_bits`` kwarg was True,
    the bits in the classical registers displayed in the same order as when
    ``reverse_bits`` was set to False.
