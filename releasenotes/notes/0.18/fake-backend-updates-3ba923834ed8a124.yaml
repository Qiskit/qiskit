features:
  - |
    A new fake backend class is available under ``qiskit.test.mock`` for the
    ``ibmq_guadalupe`` backend.  As with the other fake backends, this includes
    a snapshot of calibration data (i.e. ``backend.defaults()``) and error data
    (i.e. ``backend.properties()``) taken from the real system, and can be used
    for local testing, compilation and simulation.
upgrade:
  - |
    The existing fake backend classes in ``qiskit.test.mock`` now strictly 
    implement the :class:`~qiskit.providers.BackendV1` interface. This means
    that if you were manually constructing :class:`~qiskit.qobj.QasmQobj` or
    :class:`~qiskit.qobj.PulseQobj` object for use with the ``run()`` method
    this will no longer work. The ``run()`` method only accepts
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit` or :class:`~qiskit.pulse.Schedule`
    objects now. This was necessary to enable testing of new backends
    implemented without qobj which previously did not have any testing inside
    qiskit terra. If you need to leverage the fake backends with
    :class:`~qiskit.qobj.QasmQobj` or :class:`~qiskit.qobj.PulseQobj` new
    fake legacy backend objects were added to explicitly test the legacy
    providers interface. This will be removed after the legacy interface is
    deprecated and removed. Moving forward new fake backends will only
    implement the :class:`~qiskit.providers.BackendV1` interface and will not
    add new legacy backend classes for new fake backends.
