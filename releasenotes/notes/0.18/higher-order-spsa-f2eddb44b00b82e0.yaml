    A new optimizer class, :class:`~qiskit.algorithms.optimizers.QNSPSA`,
    has been added to the :mod:`qiskit.algorithms.optimizers` module. This
    class implements the
    `Quantum Natural SPSA (QN-SPSA) <https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.09232>`__
    algorithm, a generalization of the 2-SPSA algorithm, and estimates the
    Quantum Fisher Information Matrix instead of the Hessian to obtain a
    stochastic estimate of the Quantum Natural Gradient. For examples on
    how to use this new optimizer refer to the
    :class:`~qiskit.algorithms.optimizers.QNSPSA` class documentation.

    A new kwarg, ``second_order``, has been added to the constructor
    of the :class:`~qiskit.algorithms.optimizers.SPSA` class in the
    :mod:`qiskit.algorithms.optimizers` module. When set to ``True`` this
    enables using
    `second-order SPSA <https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/657661>`__.
    Second order SPSA, or 2-SPSA, is an extension of the ordinary SPSA algorithm that
    enables estimating the Hessian alongside the gradient, which is used
    to precondition the gradient before the parameter update step. As a
    second-order method, this tries to improve convergence of SPSA.
    For examples on how to use this option refer to the
    :class:`~qiskit.algorithms.optimizers.SPSA` class documentation.
