    Fixed an issue with the
    :meth:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.num_connected_components` method of
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit` which was returning the incorrect
    number of components when the circuit contains two or more gates conditioned
    on classical registers.
    Fixed `#6477 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/6477>`__
