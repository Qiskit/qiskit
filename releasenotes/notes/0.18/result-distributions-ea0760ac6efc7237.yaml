    Added two new classes :class:`~qiskit.result.ProbDistribution` and
    :class:`~qiskit.result.QuasiDistribution` for dealing with probability
    distributions and quasiprobability distributions respectively. These objects
    both are dictionary subclasses that add additional methods for working
    with probability and quasiprobability distributions.
