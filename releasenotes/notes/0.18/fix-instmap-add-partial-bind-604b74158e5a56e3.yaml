    Fixed an issue when passing a partially bound callable created with
    the Python standard library's ``functools.partial()`` function as the
    ``schedule`` kwarg to the
    :meth:`~qiskit.pulse.InstructionScheduleMap.add` method of the
    :class:`~qiskit.pulse.InstructionScheduleMap` class, which would previously
    result in an error.
    Fixed `#6278 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/6278>`__
