    A new class, :class:`~qiskit.quantum_info.PauliList`, has been added to
    the :mod:`qiskit.quantum_info` module. This class is used to
    efficiently represent a list of :class:`~qiskit.quantum_info.Pauli`
    operators. This new class inherits from the same parent class as the
    existing :class:`~qiskit.quantum_info.PauliTable` (and therefore can be
    mostly used interchangeably), however it differs from the
    :class:`~qiskit.quantum_info.PauliTable`
    because the :class:`qiskit.quantum_info.PauliList` class
    can handle Z4 phases.
