    A new requirement `symengine <https://pypi.org/project/symengine>`__ has
    been added for Linux (on x86_64, aarch64, and ppc64le) and macOS users
    (x86_64 and arm64). It is an optional dependency on Windows (and available
    on PyPi as a precompiled package for 64bit Windows) and other
    architectures. If it is installed it provides significantly improved
    performance for the evaluation of :class:`~qiskit.circuit.Parameter` and
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.ParameterExpression` objects.
