deprecations:
  - |
    Support for passing the ``condition`` kwarg to the
    :class:`~qiskit.dagcircuit.DAGDepNode` has been deprecated and will be
    removed in a future release. The ``condition`` attribute to the
    :class:`~qiskit.dagcircuit.DAGDepNode` has also been deprecated and
    will be removed in a future release. Instead, you can access the
    ``condition`` of a `DAGDepNode` if the node is of type ``op``, by using
    `DAGDepNode.op.condition`.
