deprecations:
  - |
    The ``condition`` kwarg to the
    :class:`~qiskit.dagcircuit.DAGDepNode` constructor along with the
    corresponding :attr:`~qiskit.dagcircuit.DAGDepNode.condition` attribute
    of the :class:`~qiskit.dagcircuit.DAGDepNode` have been deprecated and
    will be removed in a future release. Instead, you can access the
    ``condition`` of a ``DAGDepNode`` if the node is of type ``op``, by using
    ``DAGDepNode.op.condition``.
