    Fixed an issue with the :func:`~qiskit.visualization.circuit_drawer`
    function and :meth:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.draw` method of
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit` with all output modes
    where it would incorrectly render a custom instruction that includes
    classical bits in some circumstances.
    Fixed `#3201 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/3201>`__,
    `#3202 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/3202>`__, and
    `#6178 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/6178>`__
