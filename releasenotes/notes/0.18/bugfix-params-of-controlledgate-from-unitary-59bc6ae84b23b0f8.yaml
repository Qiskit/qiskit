    Fixed an issue where the :attr:`~qiskit.circuit.ControlledGate.params`
    attribute of :class:`~qiskit.circuit.ControlledGate` built from an
    :class:`~qiskit.extensions.UnitaryGate` was incorrectly set to the
    unitary matrix of the controlled version of the base
    :class:`~qiskit.extensions.UnitaryGate` instead of the original
    uncontrolled base gate. This has been corrected so the attribute is
    now correctly being set to the unitary matrix of the base
    :class:`~qiskit.extensions.UnitaryGate`.
    Fixed `#5780 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/pull/5780>`__
