fixes:
  - |
    Fix the :meth:`qiskit.opflow.SparseVectorStateFn.to_dict_fn` method, which
    previously had at most one entry for the all zero state due to an index error.
  - |
    Fix the :meth:`qiskit.opflow.SparseVectorStateFn.equals` method to return 
    `True` or `False` instead of a sparse vector comparison of the single elements.
