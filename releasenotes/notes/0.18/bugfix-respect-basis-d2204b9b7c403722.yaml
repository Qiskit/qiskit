    Fixed an issue with the preset pass managers
    :class:`~qiskit.transpiler.preset_passmanagers.level_0_pass_manager` and
    :class:`~qiskit.transpiler.preset_passmanagers.level_1_pass_manager`
    (which corresponds to ``optimization_level`` 0 and 1 for
    :func:`~qiskit.compiler.transpile`) where in some cases they would
    produce circuits not in the requested basis.
