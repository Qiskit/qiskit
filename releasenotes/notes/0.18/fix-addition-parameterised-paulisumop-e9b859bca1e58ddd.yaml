    Fixed an issue with addition between
    :class:`~qiskit.opflow.primitive_ops.PauliSumOp` objects that had
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.ParameterExpression` coefficients. Previously
    this would result in a ``QiskitError`` exception being raised because
    the addition of the :class:`~qiskit.circuit.ParameterExpression` was
    not handled correctly. This has been fixed so that addition can be
    performed between :class:`~qiskit.opflow.primitive_ops.PauliSumOp`
    objects with :class:`~qiskit.circuit.ParameterExpression` coefficients.
