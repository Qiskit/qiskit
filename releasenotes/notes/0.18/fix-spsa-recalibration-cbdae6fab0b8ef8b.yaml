    Fix a bug where using :class:`~qiskit.algorithms.optimizers.SPSA` with automatic
    calibration of the learning rate and perturbation (i.e. ``learning_rate`` and
    ``perturbation`` are ``None`` in the initializer), stores the calibration for all
    future optimizations. Instead, the calibration should be done for each new objective
    function.
