    When creating a :class:`~qiskit.quantum_info.Pauli` object with an invalid
    string label, a :class:`~qiskit.exceptions.QiskitError` is now raised.
    This is a change from previous releases which would raise an
    ``AttributeError`` on an invalid string label. This change was made to
    ensure the error message is more informative and distinct from a generic
    ``AttributeError``.
