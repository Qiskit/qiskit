    A new optimizer class,
    :class:`~qiskit.algorithms.optimizers.GradientDescent`, has been added
    to the :mod:`qiskit.algorithms.optimizers` module. This optimizer class
    implements a standard gradient descent optimization algorithm for use
    with quantum variational algorithms, such as
    :class:`~qiskit.algorithms.VQE`.
    For a detailed description and examples on how to use this class, please
    refer to the :class:`~qiskit.algorithms.optimizers.GradientDescent` class
    documentation.
