    Added a new class, :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.EvolvedOperatorAnsatz`,
    to the :mod:`qiskit.circuit.library` module. This library circuit, which
    had previously been located in
    `Qiskit Nature <https://qiskit.org/documentation/nature/>`__ , can be used
    to construct ansatz circuits that consist of time-evolved operators, where
    the evolution time is a variational parameter. Examples of such ansatz
    circuits include ``UCCSD`` class in the ``chemistry`` module of
    Qiskit Nature or the :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.QAOAAnsatz` class.
