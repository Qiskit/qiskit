    Fixed an issue with :class:`~qiskit.algorithms.VQE` algorithm class
    when run with the :class:`~qiskit.algorithms.optimizers.L_BFGS_B`
    or :class:`~qiskit.algorithms.optimizers.P_BFGS` optimizer classes and
    gradients are used, the gradient was incorrectly passed as a numpy array
    instead of the expected list of floats resulting in an error. This has
    been resolved so you can use gradients with :class:`~qiskit.algorithms.VQE`
    and the :class:`~qiskit.algorithms.optimizers.L_BFGS_B` or
    :class:`~qiskit.algorithms.optimizers.P_BFGS` optimizers.
