    Fixed an issue where the bit-order in
    :meth:`qiskit.circuit.library.PhaseOracle.evaluate_bitstring` did not agree
    with the order of the measured bitstring. This fix also affects the
    execution of the :class:`~qiskit.algorithms.Grover` algorithm class if the 
    oracle is specified as a :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.PhaseOracle`, which
    now will now correctly identify the correct bitstring.
    Fixed `#6314 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/6314>`__
