features:
  - |
    Added :meth:`.Clifford.from_matrix` method
    that creates a ``Clifford`` object from its unitary matrix.
  - |
    The constructor of :class:`.Clifford` now can take any Clifford gate object up to 3 qubits,
    such as ``Rz(pi/2)``, ``iSwapGate()`` and ``ECRGate()``, which were not convertible before.
