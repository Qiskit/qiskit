    Fixed a failure in the circuit text drawer, which could occur when circuit blocks inside
    control flow operations were defined on different registers than the outer circuit.
    This situation could for example happen when appending :class:`.ControlFlowOp` operations 
    directly, or for circuits after transpilation.
