    Fixed an issue in :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.PauliEvolutionGate` where
    labels were not correctly generated for observables composed of multiple
    Pauli terms or lists of :class:`~qiskit.quantum_info.SparseObservable` objects.
    This fix ensures that all contributing Pauli strings are reflected in the
    gate label and in circuit drawings.
