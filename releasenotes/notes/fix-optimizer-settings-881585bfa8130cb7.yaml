    Fix a bug in the :class:`~.Optimizer` classes where re-constructing a new optimizer instance
    from a previously exisiting :attr:`~.Optimizer.settings` reset both the new and previous
    optimizer settings to the defaults. This notably led to a bug if :class:`~.Optimizer` objects
    were send as input to Qiskit Runtime programs.

    Now optimizer objects are correctly reconstructed::

      >>> from qiskit.algorithms.optimizers import COBYLA
      >>> original = COBYLA(maxiter=1)
      >>> reconstructed = COBYLA(**original.settings)
      >>> reconstructed._options["maxiter"]
      1  # used to be 1000!
