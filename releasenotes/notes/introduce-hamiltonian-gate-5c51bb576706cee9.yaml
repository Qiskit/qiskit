    New `HamitlotianGate` and `QuantumCircuit.hamltonian()` methods are
    introduced, representing Hamiltonian evolution of the circuit
    wavefunction by a user-specified Hermitian Operator and evolution time.
    The evolution time can be a `Parameter`, allowing the creation of
    parameterized UCCSD or QAOA-style circuits which compile to
    `UnitaryGate`s if `time` parameters are provided. The Unitary of a
    `HamiltonianGate` with Hamiltonian Operator `H` and time parameter
    `t` is `e^-iHt`.
