upgrade:
  - |
    The arguments ``z`` and ``x``, as separate arrays to :class:`.Pauli`
    were removed, as deprecated in Qiskit Terra 0.17 (released on April, 2021).
    Use a tuple instead, such as ``Pauli((z, x[, phase]))``.
  - |
    The argument ``label`` to the initializer of
    :class:`.Pauli` were removed, as deprecated in Qiskit Terra 0.17 (released on April, 2021).
    Pass the label positionally instead, such as ``Pauli("XYZ")``.
  - |
    Importing from ``qiskit.quantum_info.operators.pauli`` is not allowed anymore, as it was
    deprecated in Qiskit Terra 0.21 (released on June, 2022). Import directly from
    ``qiskit.quantum_info`` instead.
