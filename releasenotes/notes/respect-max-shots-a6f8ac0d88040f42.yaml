    ``qiskit.compiler.assemble()`` will now respect the configured max_shots for
    a backend. If shots are specified that exceed the max shots set in the
    backend configuration this will now raise a ``QiskitError`` exception.
    Additionally, if no shots argument is provided the default value is either
    1024 (the previous behavior) or ``max_shots``, whichever is lower.
