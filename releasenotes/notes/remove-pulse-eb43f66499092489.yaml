    Qiskit Pulse has been completely removed in this release, following its deprecation in Qiskit 1.3.
    This include all pulse module files, pulse visualization functionality, support for ``ScheduleBlock``
    and pulse-gate serialization/deserialization capability in QPY, calibrations management in
    :class:`.QuantumCircuit`, :class:`.Target` and :class:`.DAGCircuit` and pulse-based fake backends.
    For more details, see the corresponding sections below.

    The Pulse package as a whole, along with major dependent components that have been removed in Qiskit, will
    be part of `Qiskit Dynamics <https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-dynamics>`__ repository to further enable
    pulse and low-level control simulation.
