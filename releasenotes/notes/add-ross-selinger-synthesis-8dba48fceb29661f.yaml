    Added :func:`approximate_rz_rotation` that contructs a 1-qubit quantum
    circuit approximating a RZ-rotation with a specified angle. The algorithm
    is described in the paper "Optimal ancilla-free Clifford+T approximation
    of z-rotations" by Neil J. Ross, Peter Selinger and is implemented 
    in https://github.com/qiskit-community/rsgridsynth.

    Added :func:`approximate_1q_unitary` that construct a 1-qubit quantum
    circuit approximating a given 1-qubit unitary matrix. The algorithm works
    by decomposing the unitary matrix into RZ-rotation, RX-rotation, and another
    RZ-rotation, and applying the Ross-Selinger algorithm to each of the
    three rotations.

    Added a new unitary synthesis plugin :class:`.RossSelingerSynthesis` that
    synthesizes 1-qubit unitary gates using the Ross-Selinger algorithm
    and produces a 1-qubit quantum circuit consisting of Clifford, T and Tdg gates.
    
    The plugin is invoked by the :class:`.UnitarySynthesis` transpiler pass
    when the parameter ``method`` is set to ``"rs"``.
