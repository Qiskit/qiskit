fixes:
  - |
    A bug that :func:`.convert_to_target` or :class:`.BackendV2Converter` raises unexpected
    error was solved. The bug occurs when the backend to convert includes calibration
    for a gate that doesn't have definition in the backend properties.
    Such gate should be broadcasted to all qubits as an ideal error-free instruction
    even though actual calibrations for finite set of qubits are reported.
upgrade:
  - |
    Update properties and defaults information of :class:`.FakeOpenPulse2Q` backend.
    Information for some missing instructions are added.
