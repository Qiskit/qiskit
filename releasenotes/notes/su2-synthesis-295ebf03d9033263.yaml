    The new function `mcsu2_real_diagonal(circuit, unitary, controls, target, ctrl_state)` 
    applies a multi-controlled SU(2) gate unitary with one real diagonal. With n-1 controls, 
    the decomposition requires approximately 16n cx gates. Synthesis of mcrx and mcry without 
    auxiliary qubits now uses the `mcsu2_real_diagonal` decomposition.
