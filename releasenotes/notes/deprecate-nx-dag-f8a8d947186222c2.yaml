deprecations:
  - |
    The `NetworkX <https://networkx.org/>`_  converter function for the
    :class:`~.DAGCircuit`, :meth:`~.DAGCircuit.to_networkx` and
    :meth:`~.DAGCircuit.from_networkx`, along with the
    :meth:`.DAGDependency.to_networkx` method have been deprecated and will be
    removed in a future release. Qiskit has been using
    `retworkx <https://qiskit.org/documentation/retworkx/>`__ as its graph
    library since the qiskit-terra 0.12.0 release and since then the networkx
    converter function have been a lossy process. They were originally added so
    that users could leverage NetworkX's algorithms library to leverage
    functionality not present in retworkx. Since that time retworkx has matured
    and offers more functionality and the :class:`~.DAGCircuit` is tightly
    coupled to retworkx for its operation. Having these converter methods
    provides limited value moving forward and are therefore going to be
    removed in a future release.
