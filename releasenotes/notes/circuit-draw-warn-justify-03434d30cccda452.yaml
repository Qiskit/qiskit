    The ``justify`` argument of :func:`circuit_drawer` or :meth:`QuantumCircuit.draw`, will
    no longer support invalid values (previously changing them to the default), and in a future
    release they will error. Valid justify values are ``"left"``, ``"right"`` or ``"none"``.
fixes:
  - |
    Fixed an issue where :func:`circuit_drawer` or the :meth:`QuantumCircuit.draw` method would
    not raise a warning when an invalid value was passed to the ``justify`` argument, before
    changing it to the default. Now, it will raise a warning if an invalid value is passed.
    Valid justify values are ``"left"``, ``"right"`` or ``"none"``. Refer to
    `#12089 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/12089>` for more details.
