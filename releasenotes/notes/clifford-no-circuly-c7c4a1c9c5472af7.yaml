    :meth:`.Clifford.from_circuit` will no longer attempt to resolve instructions whose
    :attr:`~.circuit.Instruction.definition` fields are mutually recursive with some other object.
    Such recursive definitions are already a violation of the strictly hierarchical ordering that
    the :attr:`~.circuit.Instruction.definition` field requires, and code should not rely on this
    being possible at all.  If you want to define equivalences that are permitted to have (mutual)
    cycles, use an :class:`.EquivalenceLibrary`.
