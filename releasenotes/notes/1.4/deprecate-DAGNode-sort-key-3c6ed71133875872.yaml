    The :attr:`.DAGOpNode.sort_key`, :attr:`.DAGOutNode.sort_key`, and
    :attr:`.DAGInNode.sort_key` attributes have been deprecated and will be
    removed in the Qiskit v2.0.0 release. These attributes were originally used
    as a lexicographical key for topological sorting nodes in a 
    :class:`.DAGCircuit`. However, the key is no longer used for this
    as the sorting is done internally in ``Rust`` code now. If you're using this
    attribute, you can recreate the key from the other attributes
    of a node. For example, you can use a function like::

        def get_sort_key(node: DAGNode):
            if isinstance(node, (DAGInNode, DAGOutNode)):
                return str(node.wire)
            return ",".join(
                f"{dag.find_bit(q).index:04d}" for q in itertools.chain(node.qargs, node.cargs)
            )

    which will generate a string like the sort key does.
