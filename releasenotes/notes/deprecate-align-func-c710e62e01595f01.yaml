    Pulse builder alignment context :func:`~qiskit.pulse.builder.align_func` and
    its representation :class:`~qiskit.pulse.transforms.alignments.AlignFunc` have been
    deprecated and will be removed in a future release. This context is hindrance to
    serialization of pulse programs because of the arbitrary python callable of its
    input argument. This context is expected to be used for constructing complicated
    dynamical decoupling sequences, however, you can still create the same schedule by
    manually inserting delays in between instructions.
