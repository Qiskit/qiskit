features:
  - |
    The decomposition methods for single-qubit gates in
    :class:`~qiskit.quantum_info.OneQubitEulerDecomposer` has been expanded to now
    also include the ``'ZSXX'`` basis, for making use of direct :math:`X` gate as well as :math:`\sqrt{X}`.
fixes:
  - |
    Tightened up tolerances, improved repeatability and simplification, fixed several global-phase-tracking bugs
    for one- and two-qubit gate synthesis.
