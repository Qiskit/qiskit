    The metadata of Primitives V2 implementations, i.e., :class:`.StatevectorSampler`,
    :class:`.StatevectorEstimator`, :class:`.BackendSamplerV2` and :class:`.BackendEstimatorV2`,
    has been updated to match that of IBM quantum devices.

    * ``version`` and ``circuit_metadata`` are added for all V2 implementations
    * ``shots`` is added for :class:`.BackendSamplerV2` and :class:`.BackendEstimatorV2`
    * ``precision`` is renamed with ``target_precision`` for :class:`.StatevectorEstimator`

    Note that metadata of :class:`.StatevectorEstimator` does not have ``shots`` because
    the class computes expectation values with :class:`.Statevector` and shots are not used.
