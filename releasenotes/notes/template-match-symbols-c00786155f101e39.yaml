    The :class:`.TemplateOptimization` pass will now return parametric expressions using the native
    symbolic expression format of :class:`.ParameterExpression`, rather than always using Sympy.
    For most supported platforms, this means that the expressions will be Symengine objects.
    Previously, the pass could return mismatched objects, which could lead to later failures in
    parameter-handling code.
