    The function :func:`qiskit.visualization.plot_bloch_vector`
    is enhanced to support the following-
    * The kwarg ``coord_type`` now defaults(with warning) 
      to a supported type according to its length.
    * The value of ``coord_type`` can now be case insensitive.
    * The ``coord_type`` can be set to "wave", which supports entering
      two imaginary numbers as arguments, as follows

    .. code-block:: python

        a = 5 + 6j
        b = 1 - 2j
        plot_bloch_vector([a,b],coord_type="wave")
