features:
  - |
    Added two new classes, :class:`~qiskit.utils.mitigation.CompleteMeasFitter`
    and :class:`~qiskit.utils.mitigation.TensoredMeasFitter` to the
    :mod:`qiskit.utils.mitigation` module. These classes are for use only as
    values for the ``measurement_error_mitigation_cls`` kwarg of the
    :class:`~qiskit.utils.QuantumInstance` class. The instantiation and usage
    of these classes (or anything else in :mod:`qiskit.utils.mitigation`)
    outside of the ``measurement_error_mitigation_cls`` kwarg should be treated as an
    internal private API and not relied upon.
deprecations:
  - |
    The use of the measurement mitigation classes
    :class:`qiskit.ignis.mitigation.CompleteMeasFitter` and
    :class:`qiskit.ignis.mitigation.TensoredMeasFitter` from ``qiskit-ignis``
    as values for the ``measurement_error_mitigation_cls`` kwarg of the
    constructor for the :class:`~qiskit.utils.QuantumInstance` class is
    deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Instead the equivalent
    classes from :mod:`qiskit.utils.mitigation`,
    :class:`~qiskit.utils.mitigation.CompleteMeasFitter` and
    :class:`~qiskit.utils.mitigation.TensoredMeasFitter` should be used. This
    was necessary as the ``qiskit-ignis`` project is now deprecated and will
    no longer be supported in the near future.
    It's worth noting that unlike the equivalent classes from ``qiskit-ignis``
    the versions from :mod:`qiskit.utils.mitigation` are supported only in
    their use with :class:`~qiskit.utils.QuantumInstance` (ie as a class not
    an instance with the ``measurement_error_mitigation_cls`` kwarg) and not
    intended for standalone use.
