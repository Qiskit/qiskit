    When extending a `QuantumCircuit` instance (extendee) with another circuit (extension),
    the circuit is taken via reference. If a circuit is extended with itself that
    leads to an infinite loop as extendee and extension are the same.
    This bug is resolved by copying the extension if it is the same object as
    the extendee.
