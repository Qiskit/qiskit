deprecations:
  - |
    As the credit system has not been used for several months, it is now deprecated and will no
    longer work in a future release.
    Now max_credits should not be used in:
    :class:`~qiskit.qobj.QasmQobjConfig`
    :class:`~qiskit.qobj.PulseQobjConfig`
    ``qiskit.execute()``
    For example, if you were calling execute function like::

        from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, execute, BasicAer

        backend = BasicAer.get_backend('qasm_simulator')

        qc = QuantumCircuit(5, 5)
        qc.h(0)
        qc.cx(0, range(1, 5))
        qc.measure_all()

        job = execute(qc, backend, shots=4321, max_credits=10)

    instead you should call it like::

        from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, execute, BasicAer

        backend = BasicAer.get_backend('qasm_simulator')

        qc = QuantumCircuit(5, 5)
        qc.h(0)
        qc.cx(0, range(1, 5))
        qc.measure_all()

        job = execute(qc, backend, shots=4321)
