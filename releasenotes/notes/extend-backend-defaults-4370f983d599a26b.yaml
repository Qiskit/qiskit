    PulseDefaults (accessed normally as backend.defaults()) has been extended
    with the functionality that exists in CmdDef. CmdDef will be deprecated in
    the future. There are also three new functions:
      - qubit_ops(qubits) returns the operations defined for the qubits
      - assert_has(operation, qubits) raises an error if the op isn't defined
      - remove(operation, qubits) like pop, but doesn't require parameters
    There are some differences from the CmdDef:
      - __init__ does not take any user input
      - cmds and cmd_qubits are deprecated and replaced with ops and
        qubits_with_op

    Example:
        # Get data directly from backend defaults without using CmdDef
        backend = provider.get_backend(backend_name)
        defaults = backend.defaults()
        qubit = defaults.qubits_with_op('u3')[0]
        x_gate = defaults.get('u3', qubit, P0=np.pi, P1=0, P2=np.pi)
        pulse_schedule = x_gate(DriveChannel(qubit))

    In PulseDefaults (accessed normally as backend.defaults()),
    qubit_freq_est and meas_freq_est are now returned in Hz rather than GHz.
    This means the new return values are 1e9 * their previous value.
