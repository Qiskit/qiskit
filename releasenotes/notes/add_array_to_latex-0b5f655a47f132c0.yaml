    Can now use :func:`array_to_latex()` to represent vectors and matrices as
    human-friendly LaTeX.

    .. jupyter-execute::

            from qiskit.visualization import array_to_latex
            from numpy import sqrt, exp, pi
            mat = [[0, exp(pi*.75j)],
                   [1/sqrt(8), 0.875]]
            array_to_latex(mat)
