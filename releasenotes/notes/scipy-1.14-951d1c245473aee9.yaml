    Fixed :meth:`.Operator.power` when called with non-integer powers on a matrix whose Schur form
    is not diagonal (for example, most non-unitary matrices).
  - |
    :meth:`.Operator.power` will now more reliably return the expected principal value from a
    fractional matrix power of a unitary matrix with a :math:`-1` eigenvalue.  This is tricky in
    general, because floating-point rounding effects can cause a matrix to _truly_ have an eigenvalue
    on the negative side of the branch cut (even if its exact mathematical relation would not), and
    imprecision in various BLAS calls can falsely find the wrong side of the branch cut.

    :meth:`.Operator.power` now shifts the branch-cut location for matrix powers to be a small
    complex rotation away from :math:`-1`.  This does not solve the problem, it just shifts it to a
    place where it is far less likely to be noticeable for the types of operators that usually
    appear.
