features:
  - |
    The constructor of :class:`~qiskit.transpiler.passes.RZXCalibrationBuilder`
    has two new kwargs ``instruction_schedule_map`` and ``qubit_channel_mapping``
    which take a :class:`~qiskit.pulse.InstructionScheduleMap` and list of
    channel name lists for each qubit respectively. These new arguments are used
    to directly specify the information needed from a backend target. They should
    be used instead of passing a :class:`~qiskit.providers.BaseBackend` or
    :class:`~qiskit.providers.BackendV1` object directly to the pass with the
    ``backend`` argument.

deprecations:
  - |
    For the constructor of the
    :class:`~qiskit.transpiler.passes.RZXCalibrationBuilder` passing a backend
    either as the first positional argument or with the named ``backend`` kwarg
    is deprecated and will no longer work in a future release. Instead a
    a :class:`~qiskit.pulse.InstructionScheduleMap` should be passed directly to
    the ``instruction_schedule_map`` kwarg and a list of channel name lists for
    each qubit should be passed directly to ``qubit_channel_mapping``. For example,
    if you were calling the pass like::

        from qiskit.transpiler.passes import RZXCalibrationBuilder
        from qiskit.test.mock import FakeMumbai

        backend = FakeMumbai()
        cal_pass = RZXCalibrationBuilder(backend)

    instead you should call it like::

        from qiskit.transpiler.passes import RZXCalibrationBuilder
        from qiskit.test.mock import FakeMumbai

        backend = FakeMumbai()
        inst_map = backend.defaults().instruction_schedule_map
        channel_map = self.backend.configuration().qubit_channel_mapping
        cal_pass = RZXCalibrationBuilder(
            instruction_schedule_map=inst_map,
            qubit_channel_mapping=channel_map,
        )

    This change is necessary because as a general rule backend objects are not
    pickle serializeable and it would break when it was used with multiple
    processes inside of :func:`~qiskit.compiler.transpile` when compliing
    multiple circuits at once.
