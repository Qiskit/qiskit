    Added a new class :class:`.TargetBasisType` which specifies the basis set
    targeted during transpilation. Currently the two supported basis sets are:

    * ``DEFAULT``: minimizes the number of two-qubit gates, suitable for near-term
      transpilation,
    * ``CLIFFORD_T``: minimizes the number of T-gates, suitable for fault-tolerant
      transpilation.

    Currently this class is used by the :class:`.HighLevelSynthesis` transpiler pass
    to select decompositions optimized either for the two-qubit-gate count or the
    T-count.

    Added a new argument ``target_basis_type`` of type :class:`.TargetBasisType`
    to the :class:`.HighLevelSynthesis` transpiler pass. When set to ``CLIFFORD_T``,
    the pass chooses decompositions that are more suitable for the Clifford+T gate
    set.

    The default high-level synthesis plugin for :class:`.MultiplierGate` produces
    better T-counts when transpiling into Clifford+T basis set.

    The default high-level synthesis plugin for :class:`.MCXGate` produces
    better T-counts when transpiling into Clifford+T basis set, provided at least
    1 ancilla qubit is available.
