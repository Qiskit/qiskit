    Added a new class :class:`.OptimizationMetric` which specifies the optimization
    criterion during transpilation. Currently the two supported metrics are:

    * ``COUNT_2Q``: optimizes the number of two-qubit gates,
    * ``COUNT_T``: optimizes the number of T-gates, when transpiling into a Clifford+T
      basis set.

    This class is used by the :class:`.HighLevelSynthesis` transpiler pass
    to select decompositions optimized either for the two-qubit-gate count or the
    T-count.

    Added a new argument ``optimization_metric`` of type :class:`.OptimizationMetric`
    to the :class:`.HighLevelSynthesis` transpiler pass. When set to ``COUNT_T``,
    the pass chooses decompositions that are more suitable for the Clifford+T gate
    set.

    The default high-level synthesis plugins for :class:`.ModularAdderGate` and
    :class:`.MultiplierGate` produce better T-counts when transpiling into Clifford+T
    basis set.

    The default high-level synthesis plugin for :class:`.MCXGate` produces
    better T-counts when transpiling into Clifford+T basis set, provided at least
    1 ancilla qubit is available.
