    Added a new class :class:`.TargetBasisType` representing the basis set
    targeted during transpilation. Currently the two supported basis sets are
    ``DEFAULT`` (which targets minimizing the number of two-qubit gates,
    suitable for near-term transpilation), and ``CLIFFORD_T`` (which targets
    minimizing the number of T-gates, suitable for fault-tolerant transpilation).
  - |
    Added a new argument ``target_basis_type`` of type :class:`.TargetBasisType`
    to the :class:`.HighLevelSynthesis` transpiler pass. When set to ``CLIFFORD_T``,
    the pass chooses decompositions that are more suitable for the Clifford+T gate
    set.

    The default high-level synthesis plugin for :class:`.MultiplierGate` produces
    better T-counts when transpiling into Clifford+T basis set.
  - |
    The default high-level synthesis plugin for :class:`.MCXGate` produces
    better T-counts when transpiling into Clifford+T basis set, provided at least
    1 ancilla qubit is available.
