    Fixed bugs related to `label` and `name` attribute of :class:`~qiskit.circuit.Gate` 
    when calling the ``inverse()`` function (inherited from :class:`~qiskit.circuit.Instruction`).
    Earlier, the inverse() function returned a gate with label None. Now the label of 
    inverse is built using the label calling it.
    `#6404 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/pull/6404>` for more details.
