    Port :func:`.synth_cnot_full_pmh`, used to synthesize a linear function
    into a CX network, to Rust. This produces approximately 44x speedup,
    as measured on 100 qubit circuits.

    The function :func:`.synth_cnot_full_pmh` now allows choosing the 
    (heuristically) optimal ``section_size`` by setting it to ``None``. Then, a value is 
    chosen which attempts to minimize the upper bound on the number of CX gates, that is
    :math:`\alpha \log_2(n)` where :math:`n` is the number of qubits and :math:`\alpha \approx 0.56`.

  - |
    Fixed a bug in :func:`.synth_cnot_full_pmh` where providing a ``section_size`` that did 
    not divide the number of qubits without remainder could lead to wrong results. 
    Now any ``section_size`` (at most equal to the number of qubits) synthesizes the correct
    circuit. For a (heuristically) optimal value, set ``section_size=None``.
