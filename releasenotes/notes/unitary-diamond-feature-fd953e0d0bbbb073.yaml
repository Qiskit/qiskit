    Added :meth:`qiskit.quantum_info.diamond_distance` function for computing the
    distance between two quantum channels. This is equivalent to using
    :meth:`qiskit.quantum_info.diamond_norm` to calculate the distance of two 
    channels: ``diamond_norm(chan1 - chan2)``. If both channels are unitary, the 
    implementation runs an optimisation. Refer to
    `#12341 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/12341>` for more details.
