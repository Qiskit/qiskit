    Fixed an issue in :func:`.unitary_to_gate_sequence` which caused unitary
    decomposition in RR basis to emit two R gates in some cases where the
    matrix can be expressed as a single R gate. Previously, in those cases you
    would get two R gates with the same phi parameter. Now, they are combined
    into one.
