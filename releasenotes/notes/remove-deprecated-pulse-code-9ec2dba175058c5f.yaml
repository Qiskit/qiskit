upgrade:
  - |
    The ``union`` method of :py:class:`~qiskit.pulse.Schedule` and
    :py:class:`~qiskit.pulse.Instruction` have been deprecated since
    Terra 0.12.0 and have now been removed. Use ``insert`` with ``time=0``.
  - |
    The ``scaling`` argument to the ``draw`` method of
    :py:class:`~qiskit.pulse.Schedule` and :py:class:`~qiskit.pulse.Instruction`
    has been replaced with ``scale`` since Terra 0.12.0 and now removed. Use
    ``scale`` instead.
  - |
    The ``period`` argument to :py:mod:`qiskit.pulse.library` functions has
    been replaced by ``freq`` since Terra 0.13.0 and now removed. Use ``freq``
    instead of ``period``.
