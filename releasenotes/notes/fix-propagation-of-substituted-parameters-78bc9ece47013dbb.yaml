    Previously, _substitute_parameters (i.e. replacing Parameter objects in a circuit with
    new Parameter objects) prior to decomposing a circuit would result in
    the substituted values not correctly being substituted into the decomposed gates.
    This has been resolved such that binding and decomposition may occur in any order.
