    The ``BackendV1`` class is deprecated and it will be removed not earlier than the next major release.
    There are several migration paths available depending on the main purpose of the backend object:

      - To expose backend information with no access to execution (just a hardware description), consider constructing a :class:`.Target` directly.
      - To provides access to execution capabilities, consider relying on the primitives interfaces instead.
      - Alternatively, to continue providing simultaneous :class:`.Target` (hardware information) and ``run`` (execution) capabilities, consider moving to :class:`.BackendV2` (see https://qisk.it/backendV1-to-V2).
