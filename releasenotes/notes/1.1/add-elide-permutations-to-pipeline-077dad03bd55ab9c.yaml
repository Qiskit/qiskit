    The transpiler pass :class:`~.ElidePermutations`
    runs by default with optimization level 2 and 3. Intuitively, removing
    :class:`~.SwapGate`\s and :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.PermutationGate`\s
    in a virtual circuit is almost always beneficial, as it makes the circuit shorter
    and easier to route. As :class:`~.OptimizeSwapBeforeMeasure` is a special case
    of :class:`~.ElidePermutations`, it has been removed from optimization level 3.
