    A :class:`.QuantumCircuit` can now contain typed classical variables::

        from qiskit.circuit import QuantumCircuit, ClassicalRegister, QuantumRegister
        from qiskit.circuit.classical import expr, types

        qr = QuantumRegister(2, "q")
        cr = ClassicalRegister(2, "c")
        qc = QuantumCircuit(qr, cr)
        # Add two input variables to the circuit with different types.
        a = qc.add_input("a", types.Bool())
        mask = qc.add_input("mask", types.Uint(2))

        # Test whether the input variable was true at runtime.
        with qc.if_test(a) as else_:
            qc.x(0)
        with else_:
            qc.h(0)

        qc.cx(0, 1)
        qc.measure(qr, cr)

        # Add a typed variable manually, initialized to the same value as the classical register.
        b = qc.add_var("b", expr.lift(cr))

        qc.reset([0, 1])
        qc.h(0)
        qc.cx(0, 1)
        qc.measure(qr, cr)

        # Store some calculated value into the `b` variable.
        qc.store(b, expr.bit_and(b, cr))
        # Test whether we had equality, up to a mask.
        with qc.if_test(expr.equal(expr.bit_and(b, mask), mask)):
            qc.x(0)

    These variables can be specified either as *inputs* to the circuit, or as scoped variables.
    The circuit object does not yet have support for representing typed classical-variable *outputs*,
    but this will be added later when hardware and the result interfaces are in more of a position
    to support it.  Circuits that represent a block of an inner scope may also capture variables
    from outer scopes.

    A variable is a :class:`.Var` node, which can now contain an arbitrary type, and represents a
    unique memory location within its live range when added to a circuit.  These can be constructed
    in a circuit using :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.add_var` and :meth:`~.QuantumCircuit.add_input`, or
    at a lower level using :meth:`.Var.new`.

    Variables can be manually stored to, using the :class:`.Store` instruction and its corresponding
    circuit method :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.store`.  This includes writing to :class:`.Clbit` and
    :class:`.ClassicalRegister` instances wrapped in :class:`.Var` nodes.

    Variables can be used wherever classical expressions (see :mod:`qiskit.circuit.classical.expr`)
    are valid.  Currently this is the target expressions of control-flow operations, though we plan
    to expand this to gate parameters in the future, as the type and expression system are expanded.

    See :ref:`circuit-repr-real-time-classical` for more discussion of these variables, and the
    associated data model.

    These are supported throughout the transpiler, through QPY serialization (:mod:`qiskit.qpy`),
    OpenQASM 3 export (:mod:`qiskit.qasm3`), and have initial support through the circuit visualizers
    (see :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.draw`).

    .. note::

      The new classical variables and storage will take some time to become supported on hardware
      and simulator backends.  They are not supported in the primitives interfaces
      (:mod:`qiskit.primitives`), but will likely inform those interfaces as they evolve.
