    :class:`.ParameterExpression` was updated so that fully bound instances
    that compare equal to instances of Python's built-in numeric types (like
    ``float`` and ``int``) also have hash values that match those of the other
    instances. This change ensures that these types can be used interchangeably
    as dictionary keys.
    Fixed `#12487 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/12487>`__.
