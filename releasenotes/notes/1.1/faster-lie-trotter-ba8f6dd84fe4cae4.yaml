    :meth:`.LieTrotter.synthesize` now uses :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.repeat` to generate additional repetitions of a Trotter step
    after the first Trotter step. This reduces the number of :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.compose` calls by a factor of
    ``reps`` and significantly reduces the runtime for larger operators.
