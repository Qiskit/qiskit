    The methods :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.power`,
    :meth:`.Gate.power`, as well as the similar methods on subclasses
    of subclasses of :class:`~qiskit.circuit.Gate`
    (such as of :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.SGate`) all have an additional
    have a new argument ``annotated`` which is used to return an :class:`.AnnotatedOperation`
    object when applying a power to a gate or circuit.
    The default value of ``False`` corresponds to the existing behavior.
    Furthermore, for standard gates with an explicitly defined ``power`` method,
    the argument ``annotated`` has no effect.
    For example, both
    ``SGate().power(1.5, annotated=False)`` and ``SGate().power(1.5, annotated=True)``
    return a ``PhaseGate``.
    A difference in the value of ``annotated`` manifests for gates without an explicitly defined
    power method. The value of ``False`` returns a
    :class:`~.library.UnitaryGate`, just as before, while the value of ``True``
    returns an :class:`~.AnnotatedOperation` that represents the instruction
    modified with the "power modifier".
