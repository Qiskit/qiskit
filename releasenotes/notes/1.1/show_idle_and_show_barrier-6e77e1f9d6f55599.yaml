    The parameters ``show_idle`` and ``show_barrier`` in the timeline drawers had been replaced by ``idle_wires`` and ``plot_barriers``
    respectively to match the circuit drawer parameters. Their previous names are now deprecated and will be removed in the next major
    release. The new parameters are fully equivalent.
