    Add a new synthesis method :func:`.synth_permutation_reverse_lnn_kms`
    of reverse permutations for linear nearest-neighbor architectures using
    Kutin, Moulton, Smithline method.
    This algorithm synthesizes the reverse permutation on :math:`n` qubits over
    a linear nearest-neighbor architecture using CX gates with depth :math:`2 * n + 2`.
