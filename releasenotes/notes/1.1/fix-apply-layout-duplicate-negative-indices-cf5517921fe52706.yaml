    Fixed an issue with the :meth:`.SparsePauliOp.apply_layout` and
    :meth:`.Pauli.apply_layout` methods when an invalid array with duplicate
    or negative indices were passed in for the ``layout`` argument. Previously
    this wouldn't result in an error and the transformation performed would
    not be valid. These methods will now raise a :exc:`.QiskitError` if
    duplicate indices or negative indices are provided as part of a layout.
