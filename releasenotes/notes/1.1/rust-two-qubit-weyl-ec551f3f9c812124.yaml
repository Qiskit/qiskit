features_synthesis:
  - |
    The :class:`.TwoQubitWeylDecomposition` synthesis class has been rewritten
    in Rust for better performance.
upgrade_synthesis:
  - |
    The :class:`.TwoQubitWeylDecomposition` no longer will self-specialize into
    a subclass on creation. This was an internal detail of the :class:`.TwoQubitWeylDecomposition`
    previously, and was not a documented public behavior as all the subclasses behaved
    the same and were only used for internal dispatch. However, as it was discoverable
    behavior this release note is to document that this will no longer occur and all
    instances of :class:`.TwoQubitWeylDecomposition` will be of the same type. There is no
    change in behavior for public methods of the class.

deprecations_synthesis:
  - |
    The :meth:`.TwoQubitWeylDecomposition.specialize` method is now deprecated
    and will be removed in the Qiskit 2.0.0 release. This method never had
    a public purpose and was unsafe for an end user to call as it would
    mutate the calculated decomposition in the object and produce invalid
    fields in the object. It was only used internally to construct a new
    :class:`.TwoQubitWeylDecomposition` object. Despite this it was still a
    documented part of the public API for the class and is now being
    deprecated without any potential replacement. This release it always will
    raise a ``NotImplementedError`` when called because the specialization
    subclassing has been removed as part of the Rust rewrite of the class.
