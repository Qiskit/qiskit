    `qiskit.primitives.containers.DataBin` now satisfies the `qiskit.primitives.containers.Shaped` 
    protocol. This means that every `DataBin` instance now has the additional attributes
    * `shape: tuple[int, ...]` the leading shape of every entry in the instance
    * `ndim: int` the length of `shape`
    * `size: int` the product of the entries of `shape`
    The shape can be passed to the constructor.

    The function `qiskit.primitives.containers.make_data_bin()` no longer creates and returns a 
    `qiskit.primitives.containers.DataBin` subclass. It instead always returns the `DataBin` class.
    However, it continues to exist for backwards compatibility, though will eventually be deprecated. 
    All users should migrate to construct `DataBin` instances directly, instead of instantiating 
    subclasses as output by `make_data_bin()`.
