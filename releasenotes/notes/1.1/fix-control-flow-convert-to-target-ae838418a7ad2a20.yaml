    Fixed an issue with the :func:`.convert_to_target` where the converter
    would incorrectly ignore control flow instructions if they were specified
    in the :attr:`.BackendConfiguration.supported_instructions` attribute which
    is the typical location that control flow instructions are specified in a
    :class:`.BackendConfiguration` object.
    Fixed `#11872 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/11872>`__.
