    Fixed a performance issue in :meth:`.PassManager.run` when it is running
    over multiple circuits in parallel. It will no longer spend time
    serializing the :class:`~.passmanager.PassManager` (which is a requirement for parallel
    execution) when given multiple inputs if it is only going to process the
    inputs serially.
