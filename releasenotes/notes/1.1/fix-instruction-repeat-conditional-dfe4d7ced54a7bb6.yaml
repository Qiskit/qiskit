    The method :meth:`.Instruction.repeat` now moves a set :attr:`~.Instruction.condition` to the
    outer returned :class:`~.circuit.Instruction` and leave the inner gates of its definition
    unconditional.  Previously, the method would leave :class:`.ClassicalRegister` instances within
    the inner definition, which was an invalid state, and would manifest itself as seemingly unrelated
    bugs later, such as during transpilation or export.  Fixed `#11935 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/11935>`__.
