    Added a new reduction to the :class:`.OptimizeAnnotated` transpiler pass.
    This reduction looks for annotated operations (objects of type :class:`.AnnotatedOperation`
    that consist of a base operation ``B`` and a list ``M`` of control, inverse and power
    modifiers) with the following properties:

    * the base operation ``B`` needs to be synthesized (i.e. it's not already supported
      by the target or belongs to the equivalence library)

    * the definition circuit for ``B`` can be expressed as ``P -- Q -- R`` with :math:`R = P^{-1}`

    In this case the modifiers can be moved to the ``Q``-part only. As a specific example,
    controlled QFT-based adders have the form ``control - [QFT -- U -- IQFT]``, which can be
    simplified to ``QFT -- control-[U] -- IQFT``. By removing the controls over ``QFT`` and
    ``IQFT`` parts of the circuit, one obtains significantly fewer gates in the transpiled
    circuit.

    Added two new methods to the :class:`~qiskit.dagcircuit.DAGCircuit` class:
    :meth:`qiskit.dagcircuit.DAGCircuit.op_successors` returns an iterator to
    :class:`.DAGOpNode` successors of a node, and
    :meth:`qiskit.dagcircuit.DAGCircuit.op_successors` returns an iterator to
    :class:`.DAGOpNode` predecessors of a node.
