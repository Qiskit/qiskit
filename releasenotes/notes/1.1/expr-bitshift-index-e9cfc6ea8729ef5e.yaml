    The classical realtime-expressions module :mod:`qiskit.circuit.classical` can now represent
    indexing and bitshifting of unsigned integers and bitlikes (e.g. :class:`.ClassicalRegister`).
    For example, it is now possible to compare one register with the bitshift of another::

      from qiskit.circuit import QuantumCircuit, ClassicalRegister
      from qiskit.circuit.classical import expr

      cr1 = ClassicalRegister(4, "cr1")
      cr2 = ClassicalRegister(4, "cr2")
      qc = QuantumCircuit(cr1, cr2)
      with qc.if_test(expr.equal(cr1, expr.shift_left(cr2, 2))):
          pass

    Qiskit can also represent a condition that dynamically indexes into a register::
    
      with qc.if_test(expr.index(cr1, cr2)):
          pass
