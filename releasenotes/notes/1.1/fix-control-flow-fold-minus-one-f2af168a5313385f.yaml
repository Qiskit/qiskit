    Fixed an issue with the :func:`circuit_drawer` or :meth:`QuantumCircuit.draw`
    when using the ``mpl`` output option where the program would hang if the
    circuit being drawn had a ControlFlow operation in it and the ``fold`` option
    was set to -1 (meaning no fold).
    Fixed `#12012 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/12012>`__.
