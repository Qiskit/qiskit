    :class:`.Parameter` was updated so that instances that compare equal always
    have the same hash. Previously, only the :attr:`.Parameter.uuid` was
    compared, so :class:`.Paramemter` instances with different names could
    compare equal if they had been constructed using a common value for the
    ``uuid`` parameter (which is usually not passed explicitly).
