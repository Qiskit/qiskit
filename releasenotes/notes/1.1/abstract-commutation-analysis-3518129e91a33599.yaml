    Extended the commutation analysis performed by :class:`~.CommutationChecker` to also work with
    abstract circuits, i.e. each operation in the input quantum circuit is now checked for its matrix
    representation before proceeding to the analysis step. Previously, the commutation analysis was only
    performed on physical circuits. In addition, each operation is now checked for its ability to be
    cached in the session commutation library. For example, this now enables computing
    whether :class:`.AnnotatedOperation` commute. This enables transpiler passes that rely on :class:`~.CommutationChecker` internally,
    such as :class:`.CommutativeCancellation`, to run during earlier stages of a default transpilation pipeline
    (prior to basis translation).
