    The Qiskit 1.1.0 release is a minor feature release that includes a myriad of new feature and bugfixes.
    The highlights for this release are:

      * Support for typed classical variables has been added to Qiskit's :class:`.QuantumCircuit`. These
        classical variables can be specified as inputs or as scoped variables in a :class:`.QuantumCircuit`
        where they e.g. store the output of qubit measurements or target control-flow operations. Support
        for e.g. setting gate parameters or output variables will be added in the future.

      * Two synthesis steps essential for generating hardware-conforming quantum circuits have been
        implemented in rust. This yields significant runtime speedups when decomposing unitary matrices
        into two-qubit quantum gates using :class:`.TwoQubitBasisDecomposer` and :class:`.TwoQubitWeylDecomposition`.

      * A number of new transpiler passes have been introduced to Qiskit that yield significant runtime
        speedups while also decreasing the size of the transpiled quantum circuits in many cases. Specifically,
        :class:`.ElidePermutations` and :class:`.StarPreRouting` have been demonstrated to have a significant
        impact on the routing output and runtime, :class:`.RemoveFinalReset` can improve quantum circuits
        that include resets and :class:`.OptimizeAnnotated` improves the processing of annotated operations.

      * The default pass managers have been improved by extending them with the newly introduced transpiler
        passes, a reorganization of existing passes and a fine-tuning of transpilation parameters.
