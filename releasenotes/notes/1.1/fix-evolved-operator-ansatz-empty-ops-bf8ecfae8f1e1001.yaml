fixes:
  - |
    The :class:`.EvolvedOperatorAnsatz` now correctly handles the case where the
    `operators` argument is an empty list. Previously, this would result in an
    error.
  - |
    From now on, :class:`.EvolvedOperatorAnsatz` will not have any `qregs` when
    thera are zero qubits, instead of having a :class:`.QuantumRegister` instance
    with zero qubits. This behavior aligns more consistently with its superclass 
    :class:`.QuantumCircuit`.
