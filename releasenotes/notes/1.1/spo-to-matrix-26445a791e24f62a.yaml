    The performance of :meth:`.SparsePauliOp.to_matrix` has been greatly improved for both dense and
    sparse forms.  By default, both will now take advantage of threaded parallelism available on
    your system, subject to the ``RAYON_NUM_THREADS`` environment variable.  You can temporarily
    force serial execution using the new ``force_serial`` Boolean argument to
    :meth:`~.SparsePauliOp.to_matrix`.
