deprecations_providers:
  - |
    The abstract base classes ``Provider`` and ``ProviderV1`` are now deprecated and will be removed in Qiskit 2.0.0.
    The abstraction provided by these interface definitions were not providing a huge value. solely just the attributes
    ``name``, ``backends``, and a ``get_backend()``. A _provider_, as a concept, will continue existing as a collection
    of backends. If you're implementing a provider currently you can adjust your
    code by simply removing ``ProviderV1`` as the parent class of your
    implementation. As part of this you probably would want to add an
    implementation of ``get_backend`` for backwards compatibility. For example::

        def get_backend(self, name=None, **kwargs):
          backend = self.backends(name, **kwargs)
          if len(backends) > 1:
              raise QiskitBackendNotFoundError("More than one backend matches the criteria")
          if not backends:
              raise QiskitBackendNotFoundError("No backend matches the criteria")
          return backends[0]
