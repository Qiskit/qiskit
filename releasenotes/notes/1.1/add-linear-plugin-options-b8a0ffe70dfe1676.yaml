    The :class:`.KMSSynthesisLinearFunction` plugin for synthesizing
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.LinearFunction` objects now accepts
    two additional options ``use_inverted`` and ``use_transposed``.
    These option modify the matrix on which the underlying synthesis algorithm runs
    by possibly inverting and/or transposing it, and then suitably adjust
    the synthesized circuit. By varying these options, we generally get different
    synthesized circuits, and in cases may obtain better results than for
    their default values.

    The :class:`.PMHSynthesisLinearFunction` plugin for synthesizing
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.LinearFunction` objects now accepts
    several additional options. The option ``section_size`` is passed to the underlying
    synthesis method. The options ``use_inverted`` and ``use_transposed``
    modify the matrix on which the underlying synthesis algorithm runs
    by possibly inverting and/or transposing it, and then suitably adjust
    the synthesized circuit. By varying these options, we generally get different
    synthesized circuits, and in cases may obtain better results than for
    their default values.
