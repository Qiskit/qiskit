    Support for the arm64 macOS platform has been promoted from Tier 3
    to Tier 1. Previously the platform was at Tier 3 because there was
    no available CI environment for testing Qiskit on the platform. Now
    that Github has made an arm64 macOS environment available to open source
    projects [#]_ we're testing the platform along with the other Tier 1
    supported platforms.
