    Fixed a bug in the conversion of custom pulse instructions to the legacy :mod:`qiskit.qobj` format. The bug was introduced in Qiskit 1.0.0
    and caused conversion of instructions with custom pulse shapes to raise an error. After the fix, the conversion is
    carried out correctly, and the custom pulse is converted to :class:`.pulse.Waveform` as it should.
    Fixed `#11828 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/11828>`__.
