upgrade:
  - |
    The :func:`.transpile` function has been upgraded to internally convert 
    `backend` inputs of type :class:`.BackendV1` to :class:`.BackendV2`, 
    which allows the transpilation pipeline to now access the backend 
    constraints through a :class:`.Target`. This change does not require any 
    user action.
