    The preset pass managers of :func:`.transpile` will no longer fail on circuits
    with control flow, if no hardware target or basis-gate set is specified.  They
    will now treat such abstract targets as permitting all control-flow operations.
    Fixed `#11906 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/11906>`__.
