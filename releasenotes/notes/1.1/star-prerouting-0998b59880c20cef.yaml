    Added a new transpiler pass :class:`.StarPreRouting` which is designed to identify star connectivity subcircuits
    and then replace them with an optimal linear routing. This is useful for certain circuits that are composed of
    this circuit connectivity such as Bernstein Vazirani and QFT. For example:

      .. plot:

         from qiskit.circuit import QuantumCircuit

         qc = QuantumCircuit(10)
         qc.h(0)
         qc.cx(0, range(1, 5))
         qc.h(9)
         qc.cx(9, range(8, 4, -1))
         qc.measure_all()
         qc.draw("mpl")

      .. plot:
         :include-source:

         from qiskit.circuit import QuantumCircuit
         from qiskit.transpiler.passes import StarPreRouting

         qc = QuantumCircuit(10)
         qc.h(0)
         qc.cx(0, range(1, 5))
         qc.h(9)
         qc.cx(9, range(8, 4, -1))
         qc.measure_all()
         StarPreRouting()(qc).draw("mpl")
