    A bug has been fixed in :func:`.convert_durations_to_dt` where the function would blindly apply
    a conversion from seconds to ``dt`` on circuit durations, independently of the original units of the attribute.
    This could lead to wrong orders of magnitude in the reported circuit durations.
