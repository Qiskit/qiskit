    Fixed an issue where the :class:`.ConstrainedReschedule` transpiler pass would previously error
    if the circuit contained a :class:`~.circuit.Reset` instruction. This has been corrected so that the
    pass no longer errors, however an actual hardware may behave differently from 
    what Qiskit scheduler assumes especially for 
    mid-circuit measurements and resets.
    Qiskit scheduler raises ``RuntimeWarning`` if
    it encounters circuit containing either.
    Fixed `#10354 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/10354>`__
