deprecations:
  - |
    Support for running Qiskit with Python 3.8 has been deprecated and will
    be removed in the Qiskit 1.3.0 release. The 1.3.0 is the first release after
    Python 3.8 goes end of life and is no longer supported. [1] This means that
    starting in the 1.3.0 release you will need to upgrade the Python version
    you're using to Python 3.9 or above.
