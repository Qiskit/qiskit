features:
  - |
    ``BaseEstimator`` can now accept multiple observables in the form
    of a ``PauliList``.  Previously, it was necessary to convert the
    ``PauliList`` to a ``list`` before passing it to a
    ``BaseEstimator`` subclass; otherwise it would be interpreted as a
    single ``SparsePauliOp`` observable.
deprecations:
  - |
    ``BaseEstimator``'s implicit conversion of ``observables`` in the
    form of a ``PauliList`` with multiple elements to a single
    ``SparsePauliOp`` is deprecated as of Qiskit Terra 0.24.0 and will
    be removed no sooner than 3 months after the release date.  If a
    single observable is desired from a ``PauliList`` with multiple
    elements, convert it to a ``SparsePauliOp`` before calling the
    ``Estimator``.
