    User-defined gate labels have been added to the 'latex' drawer in 
    :class:`qiskit.visualization.latex`. If a label is entered for a gate, it will
    replace the gate name when the gate is displayed..

  - |
    In a number of cases, the 'latex' drawer in :class:`qiskit.visualization.latex`
    did not display the gate name correctly, and in other cases, did not include
    gate parameters where they should be. Now the gate names will be displayed
    the same way they are displayed in the 'mpl' drawer, and parameters will
    display for all the gates that have them. In addition, some of the gates did
    not display in the correct form, and these have been fixed.
