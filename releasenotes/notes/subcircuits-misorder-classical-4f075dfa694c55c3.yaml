    If the :meth:`qiskit.circuit.Instruction.to_instruction` was used to create a subcircuit to a
    :class:`qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit` object and the subcircuit used classical registers,
    the three circuit drawers - ``mpl``, ``text``, and ``latex`` would in some instances display
    the subcircuit to the left of a measure when it should have been displayed to the right. This
    update fixes that.
