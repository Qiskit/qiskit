    The OpenQASM 3 exporter (:mod:`qiskit.qasm3`) will now output ``input`` or
    ``output`` declarations before gate declarations.  This is more consistent
    with the current reference ANTLR grammar from the OpenQASM 3 team.
    See `#7964 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/7964>`__.
