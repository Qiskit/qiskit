    Adds a :class:`~qiskit.result.BaseReadoutMitigator` abstract base class
    for implementing classical measurement error mitigators. These objects
    are intended for mitigation measurement errors in
    :class:`~qiskit.result.Counts` objects returned from execution of circuits
    on backends with measurement errors.

    Readout mitigator classes have two main methods
  
    * :meth:`expectation_value` which computes an mitigated expectation
      value and standard error of a diagonal operator from a noisy 
      :class:`~qiskit.result.Counts` object.

    * :meth:`quasi_probabilities` that computes an error mitigated
      :class:`~qiskit.result.QuasiDistribution`, including standard error,
      from a noisy counts object.

    Note that current :mod:`qiskit.algorithms` and the
    :class:`~qiskit.utils.QuantumInstance` class still use the legacy mitigators
    migrated from qiskit-ignis in :mod:`qiskit.utils.mitigation`. It is planned
    to upgrade code to use the new mitigator classes and deprecate the legacy
    mitgation code in a future release.

    Adds a :class:`~qiskit.result.LocalReadoutMitigator` class for
    performing measurement readout error mitigation of local measurement
    errors. Local measuerment errors are those that are described by a
    tensor-product of single-qubit measurement errors. 
    
    This class can be initialized with a list of *N* single-qubit of measurement
    error assignment matrices or from a backend using the readout error
    information in the backend properties.
    
    Mitigation is implemented using local assignment-matrix inversion which has
    complexity of :math:`O(2^N)` for *N*-qubit mitigation of
    :class:`~qiskit.result.QuasiDistribution` and expectation values.

    Adds a :class:`~qiskit.result.CorrelatedReadoutMitigator` class for
    performing measurement readout error mitigation of correlated measurement
    errors. This class can be initialized with a single :math:`2^N x 2^N`
    measurement error assignment matrix that descirbes the error probabilities.
    Mitigation is implemented via inversion of assigment matrix which has
    mitigation complexity of :math:`O(4^N)` of
    :class:`~qiskit.result.QuasiDistribution` and expectation values.
  - |
    Adds :meth:`~qiskit.result.QuasiDistribution.stddev_upper_bound`
    property and init kwarg to :meth:`qiskit.result.QuasiDistribution` for
    storing standard error in quasi probability estimates. This is used by
    :class:`~qiskit.result.BaseReadoutMitigator` classes to store the
    standard error in mitigated quasi probabilities.
  - |
    Adds :meth:`~qiskit.result.Counts.shots` method to
    :class:`qiskit.result.Counts` to return the sum of all outcomes in
    the counts.
