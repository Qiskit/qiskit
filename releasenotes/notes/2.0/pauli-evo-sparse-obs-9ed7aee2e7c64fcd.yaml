    The :class:`.PauliEvolutionGate` now natively supports :class:`.SparseObservable`\ s as input.
    This efficiently allows to handle evolution under projectors, which are implemented as
    controls of a phase rotation and require less gates than explicitly expanding the projector
    in terms of Paulis. For example::

      from qiskit.circuit.library import PauliEvolutionGate
      from qiskit.quantum_info import SparseObservable

      obs = SparseObservable("001")
      evo_proj = PauliEvolutionGate(obs, time=1)
      print(evo_proj.definition.draw())
