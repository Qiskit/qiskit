    Reduced the number of two-qubit gates when decomposing multi-controlled
    single-qubit unitary gates. For example:

     * For multi-controlled :class:`.YGate` on 10 qubits, the :class:`.CXGate` count was reduced by 56%.
     * For multi-controlled :class:`.HGate` on 10 qubits, the :class:`.CXGate` count was reduced by 56%.
     * For multi-controlled :class:`.SXGate` and :class:`.SXdgGate` on 10 qubits, the :class:`.CXGate` count was reduced by 80%.
     * For multi-controlled :class:`.UGate` on 10 qubits, the :class:`.CXGate` count was reduced by 31%.
