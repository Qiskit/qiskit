    The ``configuration`` method of :class:`.BasicSimulator` has been removed following its deprecation
    in Qiskit v1.3. This method returned a ``BackendConfiguration`` instance,
    a class that was part of the discontinued ``BackendV1`` workflow and is also removed in Qiskit v2.0.0.
    The individual configuration elements can now be retrieved directly from the backend or from the contained
    :class:`.Target` instance (``backend.target``).
  - |
    The ``run_experiment`` method of :class:`.BasicSimulator` has been removed.
    This method took an instance of the ``QasmQobjExperiment`` class as an input argument,
    a class that has been deprecated since Qiskit v1.2 and was removed with the ``Qobj`` workflow in Qiskit v2.0.0.
