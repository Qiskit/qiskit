    A new transpiler pass, :class:`.ContractIdleWiresInControlFlow`, is available in
    :mod:`qiskit.transpiler.passes`.  This pass removes qubits from control-flow blocks if the semantics allow it and if 
    the qubit remains idle throughout the control-flow operation.  Previously, the routing stage of the preset pass 
    managers could remove idle qubits as an unintended side effect of how the passes operated. Now, this behavior is 
    properly handled as part of an optimization pass.
