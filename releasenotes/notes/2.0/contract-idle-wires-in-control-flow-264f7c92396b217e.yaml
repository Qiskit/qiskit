    A new transpiler pass, :class:`.ContractIdleWiresInControlFlow`, is available from
    :mod:`qiskit.transpiler.passes`.  This pass removes qubits from control-flow blocks if the
    semantics allow this, and the qubit is idle throughout the control-flow operation.  Previously,
    the routing stage of the preset pass managers might have done this as an accidental side-effect
    of how they worked, but the behavior is now more properly placed in an optimization pass.
