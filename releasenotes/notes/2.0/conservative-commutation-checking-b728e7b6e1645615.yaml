    Commutation relations of :class:`~.circuit.Instruction`\ s with float-only ``params``
    were eagerly cached by the :class:`.CommutationChecker`, using the ``params`` as key to
    query the relation. This could lead to faulty results, if the instruction's definition
    depended on additional information that just the :attr:`~.circuit.Instruction.params`
    attribute, such as e.g. the case for :class:`.PauliEvolutionGate`.
    This behavior is now fixed, and the commutation checker only conservatively caches
    commutations for Qiskit-native standard gates. This can incur a performance cost if you were
    relying on your custom gates being cached, however, we cannot guarantee safe caching for
    custom gates, as they might rely on information beyond :attr:`~.circuit.Instruction.params`.

    Fixed a bug in the :class:`.CommmutationChecker`, where checking commutation of instruction
    with non-numeric values in the :attr:`~.circuit.Instruction.params` attribute (such as the
    :class:`.PauliGate`) could raise an error.
    Fixed `#13570 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/13570>`__.
