    The ``atomic_evolution`` callable argument of :class:`.ProductFormula` (and its
    subclasses :class:`.QDrift`, :class:`.LieTrotter`, and :class:`SuzukiTrotter` ) 
    has a new function signature. The old signature would take some Pauli
    operator and time coefficient and return the evolution circuit::

      def atomic_evolution(pauli_op: SparsePauliOp, time: float):
        evol_circuit = QuantumCircuit(pauli_op.num_qubits)
        # append operators to circuit
        return evol_circuit

    The new signature directly takes in an existing circuit and should append the evolution of the
    provided Pauli and given time to this circuit::

      def atomic_evolution(evol_circuit: QuantumCircuit, pauli_op: SparsePauliOp, time: float):
        # append operators to circuit, in-place modification
    
    This new implementation benefits from significantly better performance.
