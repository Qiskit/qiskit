    The ``atomic_evolution`` argument to :class:`.ProductFormula` (and its
    subclasses :class:`.QDrift`, :class:`.LieTrotter` and :class:`SuzukiTrotter` ) 
    has a new function signature. Rather than taking some Pauli
    operator and time coefficient and returning the evolution circuit, the new
    function takes in an existing circuit and should append the evolution of the
    provided Pauli and given time to this circuit. This new implementation
    benefits from significantly better performance.
