    The internal representation of :class:`.UnitaryGate` when added to 
    a :class:`.QuantumCircuit` has changed. The object stored in the circuit will
    not necessarily share a common reference to the object added to the circuit
    anymore. This behavior was never guaranteed, and mutating the
    :class:`.UnitaryGate` object directly or by reference was always unsound and
    likely to corrupt the circuit, especially when modifying the matrix.
    If you need to mutate an element in the circuit (which is **not** recommended
    as it's inefficient and error prone), you should ensure that you do something
    like::

      from qiskit.circuit import QuantumCircuit
      from qiskit.quantum_info import random_unitary
      from qiskit.circuit.library import UnitaryGate
      import numpy as np

      qc = QuantumCircuit(2)
      qc.unitary(np.eye(2, dtype=complex))

      new_op = UnitaryGate(random_unitary(2))
      qc.data[0] = qc.data[0].replace(operation=new_op)

    This also applies to :class:`.DAGCircuit`, but you can use
    :meth:`.DAGCircuit.substitute_node` instead.

    The :attr:`.CircuitInstruction.params` attribute for a :class:`.CircuitInstruction`
    that contains an :class:`.UnitaryGate` for its :attr:`~.CircuitInstruction.operation`
    will no longer contain the underlying unitary matrix for the gate.
    This is because the internal representation of the gate no longer
    treats the matrix object as a parameter. If you need to access the
    matrix of the gate you can do this either via the
    :attr:`.CircuitInstruction.matrix` or the :attr:`.UnitaryGate.params`
    field of the :attr:`.CircuitInstruction.operation`.
