    With the removal of pulse in Qiskit v2.0.0, support for serializing ``ScheduleBlock`` programs
    through the :func:`qiskit.qpy.dump` function has been removed. Users can still load payloads
    containing pulse gates by using the :func:`qiskit.qpy.load` function, however, they will be
    treated as opaque custom instructions. Loading ``ScheduleBlock`` payloads is not supported
    anymore and will cause a :class:`.QpyError` exception.
