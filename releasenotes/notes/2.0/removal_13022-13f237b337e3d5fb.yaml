    The deprecated :class:`.DAGNode` ``dag`` argument has been removed from the
    :class:`.DAGNode` class and its subclasses: :class:`.DAGOpNode`, :class:`.DAGOutNode`,
    and :class:`.DAGInNode`.

    The ``dag`` parameter was an optional argument when constructing these objects,
    but it has been unused and ignored since the v1.3 release, and deprecated since the v1.4 release.
