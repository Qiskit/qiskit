    The :func:`.qpy.load` function can now raise a
    :class:`.MissingOptionalLibrary` exception if a QPY v10, v11, or v12
    payload is passed in that is using symengine symbolic expressions
    and symengine is not installed. Or if sympy is not installed for any
    other QPY payload < v13. In the Qiskit 1.x releases symengine and sympy
    were always guaranteed to be installed, but starting in 2.x this is no
    longer a hard requirement and may only be needed if you're deserializing a QPY
    file that was generated using symengine. Parsing these QPY payloads
    requires symengine (0.11.0 or 0.13.0) as it's usage is baked into the
    format specification for QPY v10, v11, and v12 so if the payload requires
    it there is no option but to install a compatible version of symengine.
    Similarly, sympy was was used for :class:`.ParameterExpression` encoding
    for all QPY versions from 1 through 12.

    The minimum QPY compatibility version, :attr:`.QPY_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION`,
    has been raised to 13 from 10 in the 1.x release. This version controls
    the minimum version of QPY that can be emitted by the :func:`.qpy.dump`
    function. This means :func:`.qpy.dump` can only emit QPY v13 and v14
    in this release. QPY v13 is still compatible with Qiskit 1.3.x and 1.4.x
    which means payloads can be generated in Qiskit 2.x that can be loaded
    with the Qiskit 1.x release series still.

    This change was necessary as QPY versions 10 through 12 requires either
    the sympy and symengine libraries to generate a serialization for
    :class:`.ParameterExpression` objects, but in Qiskit 2.x neither library
    is required for the :class:`.ParameterExpression` object.

    The :meth:`.ParameterExpression.sympify` method can now raise a
    :class:`.MissingOptionalLibrary` exception if ``sympy`` is not installed.
    In the Qiskit 1.x releases sympy was always guaranteed to be installed,
    but starting in 2.x this is no longer a hard requirement and may only be
    needed if you are using this method. As this functionality explicitly
    requires ``sympy`` you will need to ensure you have ``sympy`` installed
    to use the method.
upgrade_visualization:
  - |
    The :func:`.array_to_latex` and :meth:`.Operator.draw` methods can now
    raise a :class:`.MissingOptionalLibrary` exception if the ``sympy``
    library is not installed. In the Qiskit 1.x releases symengine and sympy
    were always guaranteed to be installed, but starting in 2.x this is no
    longer a hard requirement. The latex visualization for a matrix relies
    on the sympy library, so if you're using this functionality you should
    ensure that you have sympy installed.
