    Removed the abstract base classes ``Provider`` and ``ProviderV1``, which have been
    deprecated since Qiskit v1.1.0. The abstraction provided by these interface definitions
    was not offering significant value, only including the attributes ``name``, ``backends``,
    and a ``get_backend()`` method.

    A `rovider`, as a concept, will continue existing as a collection of backends.
    If you're currently implementing a provider, you can adjust your code by simply
    removing ``ProviderV1`` as the parent class of your implementation.

    As part of this change, you will likely want to add an implementation of ``get_backend``
    for backwards compatibility. For example::

      def get_backend(self, name=None, **kwargs):
        backend = self.backends(name, **kwargs)
        if len(backends) > 1:
          raise QiskitBackendNotFoundError("More than one backend matches the criteria")
        if not backends:
          raise QiskitBackendNotFoundError("No backend matches the criteria")
        return backends[0]
