    Removed the abstract base classes ``Provider`` and ``ProviderV1``, which have been 
    deprecated since Qiskit 1.1.0. The abstraction provided by these interface definitions 
    was not offering significant value, only including the attributes ``name``, ``backends``, 
    and a ``get_backend()`` method.  

    A _provider_, as a concept, will continue existing as a collection of backends.  
    If you're currently implementing a provider, you can adjust your code by simply  
    removing ``ProviderV1`` as the parent class of your implementation.  

    As part of this change, you will likely want to add an implementation of ``get_backend``  
    for backwards compatibility. For example::  

      def get_backend(self, name=None, **kwargs):
        backend = self.backends(name, **kwargs)
        if len(backends) > 1:
          raise QiskitBackendNotFoundError("More than one backend matches the criteria")
        if not backends:
          raise QiskitBackendNotFoundError("No backend matches the criteria")
        return backends[0]
