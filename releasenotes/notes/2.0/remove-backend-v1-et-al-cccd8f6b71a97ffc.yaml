    The ``BackendV1`` model has been removed following its deprecation in 
    Qiskit 1.2.0. This includes the ``BackendV1`` class as well as related
    modules and utils, as they have been superseded by the :class:`.BackendV2` 
    model. The list of removed items includes:

    * ``BackendV1`` class: the core of the removed model

    * All elements in `qiskit/providers/models`, as they were used to represent 
      components of the ``BackendV1`` model:

        * ``BackendConfiguration``
        * ``BackendProperties``
        * ``BackendStatus``
        * ``QasmBackendConfiguration``
        * ``PulseBackendConfiguration``
        * ``UchannelLO``
        * ``GateConfig`` 
        * ``PulseDefaults`` 
        * ``PulseQobjDef``
        * ``Command``
        * ``GateProperties``  
        * ``Nduv``    
        * ``JobStatus``: This class has been superseded by the more widely used :class:`.JobStatus`
        * ``PulseDefaults``

    * ``BackendV2Converter`` class: used to convert from ``BackendV1`` to :class:`.BackendV2` 

    * ``convert_to_target`` function: used to build a :class:`.Target` instance from 
      legacy ``BackendV1`` components (such as ``BackendConfiguration`` or ``BackendProperties``)

    * ``BackendPropertyError`` and ``BackendConfigurationError``: exceptions linked to removed classes

   As a consequence of the removal of the ``BackendV1`` model, the :class:`.BackendSamplerV2` and 
   :class:`.BackendEstimatorV2` classes no longer accept inputs of type ``BackendV1`` in their 
   ``backend`` input argument.

upgrade_transpiler:
 - | 
   As a consequence of the removal of the ``BackendV1`` model, the accepted input types of the following 
   transpiler objects have been updated:
   
    * The :func:`.generate_preset_pass_manager` and :func:`.transpile` functions no longer accept inputs of
      type ``BackendV1`` in their ``backend`` input argument.
    
    * The :meth:`.Target.from_configuration` method no longer accepts a ``backend_properties`` argument

    * The :meth:`.Target.target_to_backend_properties` method has been removed

upgrade_visualization:
  - |
   As a consequence of the removal of the ``BackendV1`` model, the :func:`.plot_gate_map`,  :func:`.plot_error_map`
   and :func:`.plot_circuit_layout` functions no longer accept inputs of type ``BackendV1`` in their 
   ``backend`` input argument.

upgrade_misc:

    The ``Qobj`` structure and related classes, deprecated in Qiskit 1.2.0,
    have been removed. They were introduced as part of the ``BackendV1``
    workflow and are no longer necessary for interacting with :class:`.BackendV2` backends.
    This removal includes:

    *    ``QobjExperimentHeader``
    *    ``QobjHeader``
    *    ``QasmQobj``
    *    ``QasmQobjInstruction``
    *    ``QasmQobjExperimentConfig``
    *    ``QasmQobjExperiment``
    *    ``QasmQobjConfig``
    *    ``QasmExperimentCalibrations``
    *    ``GateCalibration``
    *    ``PulseQobj``
    *    ``PulseQobjInstruction``
    *    ``PulseQobjExperimentConfig``
    *    ``PulseQobjExperiment``
    *    ``PulseQobjConfig``
    *    ``QobjMeasurementOption``
    *    ``PulseLibraryItem``

    The :class:`.MeasLevel` and :class`.MeasReturnType` classes, previously defined in 
    ``qobj/utils.py``, have been migrated to ``result/models.py`` following the removal
    of the ``qobj`` module. These classes were not part of the public API. 
    The import path has been updated 
    from: ``from qiskit.qobj.utils import MeasLevel, MeasReturnType`` to: 
    ``from qiskit.result import MeasLevel, MeasReturnType``.

  - |
    The use of positional arguments in the constructor of :class:`.Result` has been disabled.
    Please set all arguments using kwarg syntax, i.e: ``Result(backend_name="name", ....)``.
    In addition to this, the ``qobj_id`` argument will no longer be used in the construction
    of the :class:`.Result` internals. It is still possible to set ``qobj_id`` as a
    generic kwarg, which will land in the metadata field with the other generic kwargs.
