    The deprecated ``StochasticSwap`` transpiler pass, and its associated
    built-in routing stage plugin `"stochastic"`, have been removed. These
    were marked as deprecated in the Qiskit 1.3.0 release. The pass has
    been superseded by the :class:`.SabreSwap` which should be used instead
    as it offers better performance and output quality. For example if the
    pass was previously invoked via the transpile function such as with::

      from qiskit import transpile
      from qiskit.circuit import QuantumCircuit
      from qiskit.transpiler import CouplingMap
      from qiskit.providers.fake_provider import GenericBackendV2


      qc = QuantumCircuit(4)
      qc.h(0)
      qc.cx(0, range(1, 4))
      qc.measure_all()

      cmap = CouplingMap.from_heavy_hex(3)
      backend = GenericBackendV2(num_qubits=cmap.size(), coupling_map=cmap)

      tqc = transpile(
          qc,
          routing_method="stochastic",
          layout_method="dense",
          seed_transpiler=12342,
          target=backend.target
      )

    this should be replaced with::


      tqc = transpile(
          qc,
          routing_method="sabre",
          layout_method="dense",
          seed_transpiler=12342,
          target=backend.target
      )
