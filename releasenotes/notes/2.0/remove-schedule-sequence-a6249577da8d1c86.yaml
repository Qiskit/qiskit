    The functions ``sequence`` and  ``schedule`` from the :mod:`.compiler` 
    module have been removed following their deprecation in Qiskit 1.3.
    They relied on being able to translate circuits to pulse using backend
    definitions, a capability that is no longer present. For this reason
    they have been removed with no proposed alternative.
    Note that this removals relate to the Pulse package which is 
    also being removed in Qiskit 2.0.
