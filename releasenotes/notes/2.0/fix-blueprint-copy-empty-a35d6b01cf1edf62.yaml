    :meth:`.BlueprintCircuit.copy_empty_like` now returns an empty :class:`.QuantumCircuit`
    with the same number of qubits and clbits, and the same metadata as the original circuit, instead
    of a :class:`.BlueprintCircuit`. This change addresses unexpected behavior where dealing with
    an "empty" copy of a blueprint circuit would cause the circuit data to be rebuilt.
    Note that :meth:`.BlueprintCircuit.copy` still returns a :class:`.BlueprintCircuit`.
    While ``BlueprintCircuit`` is not a public class as it's an internal
    type used for building legacy entries in :mod:`qiskit.circuit.library`
    this impacts its subclasses such as :class:`.NLocal` and
    :class:`.ZZFeatureMap`. Refer to the :mod:`qiskit.circuit.library` for
    a complete list of the classes impacted by this change.
    Fixed `#13535 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/13535>`__
