    The Multiple-Control-Multiple-Target in :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.generalized_gates.MCMT` is now deprecated
    and replaced by :class:`.MCMTGate`, which is a proper :class:`.Gate` subclass. Using
    a gate instead of a circuit allows the compiler to reason about the object at a higher
    level of abstraction and allows for multiple synthesis plugins.
