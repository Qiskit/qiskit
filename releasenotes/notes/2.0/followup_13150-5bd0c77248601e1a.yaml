    The Multiple-Control-Multiple-Target circuit class :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.generalized_gates.MCMT` 
    is now deprecated and was replaced by :class:`.MCMTGate`, which is a proper :class:`.Gate` subclass. Using
    a gate instead of a circuit allows the compiler to reason about the object at a higher
    level of abstraction and allows multiple synthesis plugins to be applied.
