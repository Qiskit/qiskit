    Added a new option, ``collect_from_back``, to the
    :class:`~qiskit.transpiler.passes.CollectMultiQBlocks` transpiler pass.
    When set to ``True``, the blocks are collected in the reverse direction, 
    from the outputs toward the inputs of the circuit. The blocks are still
    reported following the normal topological order. 
    This leads to an additional flexibility provided by the pass, and 
    additional optimization opportunities when combined with a circuit 
    resynthesis method.
