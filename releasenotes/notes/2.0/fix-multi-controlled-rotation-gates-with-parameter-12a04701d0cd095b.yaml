    Fixed a bug with multi-controlled rotations where the rotation angle was a :class:`.ParameterExpression`.
    Attempting synthesis in this case would lead to an error stating that the gate cannot be synthesized 
    with an unbound parameter.
    This bug affected multi-controlled rotation circuit methods :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.mcrx`,
    :meth:.QuantumCircuit.mcry, and :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.mcrz`, as well as when calling :meth:`.RXGate.control`, 
    :meth:`.RYGate.control`, or :meth:`.RZGate.control` when the rotation angle was a :class:`.ParameterExpression`.
    Now, these multi-controlled rotation circuits can be synthesized without raising an error.
