features_transpiler:
  - |
    A new ``"default"`` :ref:`routing plugin stage <transpiler-preset-stage-routing>` was added.  
    In Qiskit v2.0.0, this is simply an alias for the previous default ``"sabre"``.
    The underlying default algorithm may change over the course of the Qiskit v2.x release series for some or
    all targets, but you can always set explicitly ``routing_method="sabre"`` to maintain
    the current behavior.

    The :ref:`routing plugin stage <transpiler-preset-stage-routing>` name ``default`` is
    now reserved for the Qiskit built-in plugin of the same name.
