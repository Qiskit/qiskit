    :mod:`qiskit.utils` now contains utilities to provide better control and inspection of Qiskit's
    :mod:`multiprocessing` parallelization settings.  In particular, one can now use
    :func:`.should_run_in_parallel` to query whether :func:`.parallel_map` (and pass managers) will
    launch subprocesses for suitable inputs, and use the context manager
    :func:`.should_run_in_parallel.override` to temporarily override most system and user
    configuration around this decision.

    An additional function, :func:`.default_num_processes` reads the default maximum number of
    subprocesses that Qiskit will use for process-based parallelism.

    A new environment variable, ``QISKIT_IGNORE_USER_SETTINGS``, now controls whether to read the
    user settings file on ``import qiskit``.  If set to the string ``true``, the settings file
    will not be read.  This is useful for isolating certain instances of Qiskit from the system
    environment, such as for testing.
