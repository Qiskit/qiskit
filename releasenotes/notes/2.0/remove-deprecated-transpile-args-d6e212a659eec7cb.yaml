    The following :func:`.transpile` and :func:`.generate_preset_pass_manager` input arguments,
    deprecated since Qiskit 1.3 , have been removed from the API:

      * `instruction_durations`

      * `timing_constraints`
    
    In addition to this, the specification of custom basis gates through the ``basis`` gate argument of
    :func:`.transpile` and :func:`.generate_preset_pass_manager`, also deprecated in Qiskit 1.3, is
    no longer allowed, and a ``ValueError`` will be raised in these cases.

    The information formerly provided through these can still be specified via the ``backend`` or 
    ``target`` arguments. You can build a `Target` instance with defined instruction durations doing::

      Target.from_configuration(..., instruction_durations=...)

    
    For specific timing constraints::

      Target.from_configuration(..., timing_constraints=...)

    And for custom basis gates, you can manually add them to the target or use ``.from_configuration``
    with a custom name mapping, for example::

        from qiskit.circuit.library import XGate
        from qiskit.transpiler.target import Target
        
        basis_gates = ["my_x", "cx"]
        custom_name_mapping = {"my_x": XGate()}
        target = Target.from_configuration(
            basis_gates=basis_gates, num_qubits=2, custom_name_mapping=custom_name_mapping
        )

    The :func:`.transpile` and :func:`.generate_preset_pass_manager` interfaces now
    raise a ``UserWarning`` when providing a ``coupling_map`` and/or ``basis_gates`` 
    along with a ``backend``. In these cases there are multiple sources of truth, 
    the user intentions are not always clear, and there can be conflicts that  
    :func:`.generate_preset_pass_manager` may not know how to resolve. In these cases,
    we highly encourage the creation of a custom target that combines the chosen
    constraints.

    One of these situations is the specification of a gate with 3 or more qubits in
    `backend` or `basis_gates` together with a custom coupling map. The coupling map
    does not provide the necessary connectivity details to be able to determine the 
    action of the gate. In these cases, :func:`.transpile` and 
    :func:`.generate_preset_pass_manager` now raise a ``ValueError``.
