    Primitive V1 implementations and V1-exclusive non-versioned type aliases, deprecated in
    Qiskit v1.2, have been removed. These interfaces have been superseded by their V2 counterparts. 
    The removal includes the following classes implementing V1 interfaces:

    * ``Estimator``, in favor of the V2 equivalent, :class:`.StatevectorEstimator`
    * ``Sampler``, in favor of the V2 equivalent, :class:`.StatevectorSampler`
    * ``BackendEstimator``, in favor of the V2 equivalent, :class:`.BackendEstimatorV2`
    * ``BackendSampler``, in favor of the V2 equivalent, :class:`.BackendSamplerV2`

    As well as the following non-versioned type aliases:
    
    * ``BaseEstimator``, alias for :class:`.BaseEstimatorV1`
    * ``BaseSampler``, alias for :class:`.BaseSamplerV1`

    This removal does NOT affect the explicitly-versioned :class:`BaseEstimatorV1` 
    and :class:`BaseSamplerV1` abstract
    interface definitions or related result and job classes, which have been kept to maintain
    backwards compatibility. If you are using a non-versioned V1-type alias such as ``BaseEstimator``,
    you can directly replace it with the versioned type (:class:`.BaseEstimatorV1`).

    Additionally, the following utility functions have been removed. These functions were only
    used in Primitive V1 implementations:

    * ``init_circuit``: to initialize a circuit from a :class:`.Statevector`,
      use :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.initialize` instead.
    * ``init_observable``: use the constructor of :class:`.SparsePauliOp` instead.
    * ``final_measurement_mapping``: use :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.layout` and
      :meth:`.SparsePauliOp.apply_layout` to adjust an operator for a layout.
      Otherwise, use ``mthree.utils.final_measurement_mapping``.
      See `Mthree Utility functions <https://qiskit-extensions.github.io/mthree/apidocs/utils.html>`__
      for details.
