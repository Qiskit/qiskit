    Fixed a bug in :meth:`.RZGate.control` for more than 1 control qubit, which used
    an unnecessarily expensive decomposition.
    Fixed `#13473 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/13473>`__.

    The generic control method for gates now avoids attempting to translate gates
    into a supported basis, if the gate is already supported. This can slightly change the
    synthesis of the controlled gate, although it should not increase the two-qubit gate count.
