    The internal function ``qiskit.circuit.add_control.add_control`` has been removed.
    This function was not part of the public API, it had fragile preconditions to uphold 
    and was a common source of bugs. Uses of ``add_control(SomeGate(...), ...)``
    should change to ``SomeGate(...).control(...)`` using :meth:`.Gate.control` instead, which is far safer.
