    When :class:`.SabreLayout` is used to do both layout and routing simultaneously (as is the case
    for the default options to :func:`.transpile` and :func:`.generate_preset_pass_manager`) on a
    :class:`.Target` or :class:`.CouplingMap` with disjoint connectivity, and the input circuit fits
    into a single component of the coupling map, the routing permutation will now be tracked
    correctly.

    Previously, any qubits in the coupling map that were not connected, even indirectly, to a qubit
    used by the routed circuit would not be included in the final routing permutation.  This could
    cause surprising behaviour a long way from the point of failure, even if compilation appeared to
    succeed, such as calls to :meth:`.TranspileLayout.final_index_layout` raising :exc:`KeyError`.

    This bug did not affect backends that were fully connected, as most are.
