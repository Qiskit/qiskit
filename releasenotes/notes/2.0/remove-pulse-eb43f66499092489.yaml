    Qiskit Pulse has been completely removed in this release, following its deprecation in Qiskit v1.3.
    This includes all pulse module files, pulse visualization functionality, support for ``ScheduleBlock``
    and pulse-gate serialization and deserialization in QPY, calibrations management in
    :class:`.QuantumCircuit`, :class:`.Target` and :class:`.DAGCircuit`, and pulse-based fake backends.
    For more details about the removed components related to pulse, see the corresponding sections below.

    Note that Pulse migration to Qiskit Dynamics, as was the initial plan following the deprecation of Pulse,
    has been put on hold due to Qiskit Dynamics development priorities. Users wanting to use Qiskit Pulse
    as a frontend to supporting backends or in other uses cases can still use it in Qiskit versions prior
    to v2.0.0, which include pulse functionality.
