    The :class:`.Split2QUnitaries` transpiler pass has been upgraded to
    handle the case where the unitary in consideration can be written
    as a :class:`.SwapGate` gate and two single-qubit gates. In this case, it splits the
    unitary and also applies virtual swapping, similar to what is done in
    :class:`.ElidePermutations`. This functionality can be controlled with a new argument,
    ``split_swap``, in the constructor of :class`.Split2QUnitaries`, which can be used to disable
    splitting swap equivalent gates.
