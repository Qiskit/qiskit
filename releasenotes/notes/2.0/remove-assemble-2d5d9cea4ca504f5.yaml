    The ``assemble`` function and related capabilities (contained in the ``assembler`` module)
    have been removed from the codebase following their deprecation in Qiskit 1.2. 
    ``assemble`` was used to generate ``Qobj`` in the context of the
    deprecated  ``BackendV1`` workflow. The conversion is no longer necessary as the
    transpilation and primitives pipeline handles quantum circuits directly, rendering the 
    ``Qobj`` obsolete.

    The removal includes the following public API components:

      * ``qiskit.compiler.assemble`` function
      * ``qiskit.assembler.assemble_circuits`` function
      * ``qiskit.assembler.assemble_schedules`` function
      * ``qiskit.assembler.disassemble`` function
      * ``qiskit.assembler.RunConfig`` class
      * ``qiskit.circuit.Instruction.assemble`` method
