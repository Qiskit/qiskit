    An issue where :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.qubit_stop_time` and 
    :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.qubit_duration` returned incorrect time (duration) was fixed.
    It was triggered when some qubits have instructions but other qubits are idle.
    Fixes `#8729 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/8729>`__.
