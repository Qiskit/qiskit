    All fake backend classes based on the deprecated ``BackendV1`` have been removed from the :mod:`.providers.fake_provider` module.
    These classes have been deprecated since Qiskit 1.2 and were part of the deprecated ``BackendV1`` workflow. Their use in tests
    has been replaced with the :class:`.GenericBackendV2` class, which allows to create custom instances of :class:`.BackendV2` that
    implement a simulated :meth:`.BackendV2.run`. The removal affects:

    * Base classes:

      * ``FakeBackend``
      * ``FakePulseBackend``
      * ``FakeQasmBackend``

    * Fake backends for special testing purposes:
      * ``Fake1Q``
      * ``FakeOpenPulse2Q``
      * ``FakeOpenPulse3Q``

    * Legacy fake backends:

      * ``Fake5QV1``
      * ``Fake20QV1``
      * ``Fake7QPulseV1``
      * ``Fake27QPulseV1``
      * ``Fake127QPulseV1``
