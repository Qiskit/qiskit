    Removed the deprecated ``DAGNode.sort_key`` attribute. This attribute was deprecated
    in the Qiskit 1.4.0 release. As the lexicographical topological sorting is done internally
    and rust and the sort key attribute was unused this was removed to remove the overhead
    from DAG node creation. If you were relying on the sort key you can reproduce it from
    a given node using something like::

        def get_sort_key(node: DAGNode):
            if isinstance(node, (DAGInNode, DAGOutNode)):
                return str(node.wire)
            return ",".join(
                f"{dag.find_bit(q).index:04d}" for q in itertools.chain(node.qargs, node.cargs)
            )
