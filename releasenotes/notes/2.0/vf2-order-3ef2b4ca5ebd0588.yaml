upgrade_transpiler:
  - |
    The default value for the :func:`.generate_routing_passmanager` argument
    ``seed_transpiler`` has changed from ``None`` to ``-1``. This was done
    because this flag was only used to configure the :class:`.VF2PostLayout`
    transpiler pass in the output, and for that pass in particular the
    randomization typically only hurts performance and is not desirable.
    If you were relying on the previous default value you can restore this
    behavior by explicitly setting the argument ``seed_transpiler=None``. If
    you were explicitly setting a seed value for this parameter there is no
    change in behavior.
