upgrade_transpiler:
  - |
    The default value for the :func:`.generate_routing_passmanager` argument
    ``seed_transpiler`` has changed from ``None`` to ``-1``. This change was made
    because this flag was only used to configure the :class:`.VF2PostLayout`
    transpiler pass, and for that pass, the
    randomization typically degrades performance and is not desirable.
    If you relied on the previous default value, you can restore this
    behavior by explicitly setting the argument ``seed_transpiler=None``. If
    you were explicitly setting a seed value for this parameter, there is no
    change in behavior.
