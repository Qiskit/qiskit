    The method :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.measure_active` has changed the name of the classical register it creates,
    as the previous name conflicted with an OpenQASM reserved word. Instead of ``measure``, it is now called ``meas``,
    aligning with the register name used by :meth:`~.QuantumCircuit.measure_all`.
