    The :meth:`.DAGCircuit.control_flow_op_nodes` method has been updated to always return a list, even if it is empty.  Previously,
    it returned ``None`` if it was empty, and never returned an empty list, which required special handling.
    If you need to explicitly test for emptiness in both Qiskit v1.x and v2.x, you can do::

      control_flow_nodes = dag.control_flow_op_nodes()
      if not control_flow_nodes:
          # There are no control-flow nodes.
          pass
