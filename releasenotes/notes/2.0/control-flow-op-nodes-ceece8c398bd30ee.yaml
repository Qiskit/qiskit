    :meth:`.DAGCircuit.control_flow_op_nodes` now always returns a list, even if empty.  Previously,
    it returned ``None`` if empty, and never returned the empty list, which required special handling.
    If you need to explicitly test for emptiness in both Qiskit 1.x and 2.x, you can do::

      control_flow_nodes = dag.control_flow_op_nodes()
      if not control_flow_nodes:
          # There are no control-flow nodes.
          pass
