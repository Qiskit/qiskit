    Fixed a bug in the :class:`.UnitarySynthesis` transpiler pass, where blocks of
    :class:`.UnitaryGate`\s on 3 qubits or more were not correctly synthesized.
    This led, e.g., to the circuit being overwritten with the last processed block or
    to internal panics when encountering measurements after such a block.
    Fixed `#13586 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/13586>`__.
