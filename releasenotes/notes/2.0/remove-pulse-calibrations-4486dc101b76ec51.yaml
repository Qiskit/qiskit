    As part of Pulse removal in Qiskit v2.0.0, the ``calibrations`` property has been removed
    from the :class:`.QuantumCircuit`, :class:`.DAGCircuit` and :class:`.DAGDependency` classes.
    In addition to this, the method ``has_calibration_for`` has been removed from the :class:`.QuantumCircuit` and
    :class:`.DAGCircuit` classes, and ``add_calibration`` has been removed from :class:`.QuantumCircuit`.

    As part of Pulse removal in Qiskit 2.0, all pulse and calibration related functionality
    in the transpiler have been removed.

    The following passes and functions have been removed:

      * ``qiskit.transpiler.passes.PulseGates`` pass
      * ``qiskit.transpiler.passes.ValidatePulseGates``  pass
      * ``qiskit.transpiler.passes.RXCalibrationBuilder`` pass
      * ``qiskit.transpiler.passes.RZXCalibrationBuilder`` pass
      * ``qiskit.transpiler.passes.RZXCalibrationBuilderNoEcho`` pass
      * ``qiskit.transpiler.passes.EchoRZXWeylDecomposition`` pass
      * ``qiskit.transpiler.passes.NoramlizeRXAngle`` pass
      * ``qiskit.transpiler.passes.rzx_templates()`` function

    The ``inst_map`` argument has been removed from the following elements:

      * The :func:`.generate_preset_pass_manager` and :func:`.transpile` functions
      * The :meth:`.Target.from_configuration` method
      * The constructor of the :class:`.PassManagerConfig` class

    Calibration support has been removed:

      * ``calibration`` has been removed from the :class:`.InstructionProperties` constructor and is no longer a property of that class.
      * The ``has_calibration``, ``get_calibration``, ``instruction_schedule_map`` and ``update_from_instruction_schedule_map`` methods have been removed from the :class:`.Target` class.

upgrade_misc:

    As part of pulse removal in Qiskit 2.0.0, the ``sequence`` and ``schedule_circuit`` functions from :mod:`.qiskit.scheduler`
    together with the ``ScheduleConfig`` class have been removed.
