    As part of Pulse removal in Qiskit 2.0, all pulse and calibration related functionality
    in the transpiler has been removed. This includes the following:

    The following passes and function have been removed:

      * ``qiskit.transpiler.passes.PulseGates`` pass
      * ``qiskit.transpiler.passes.ValidatePulseGates``  pass
      * ``qiskit.transpiler.passes.RXCalibrationBuilder`` pass
      * ``qiskit.transpiler.passes.RZXCalibrationBuilder`` pass
      * ``qiskit.transpiler.passes.RZXCalibrationBuilderNoEcho`` pass
      * ``qiskit.transpiler.passes.EchoRZXWeylDecomposition`` pass
      * ``qiskit.transpiler.passes.NoramlizeRXAngle`` pass
      * ``qiskit.transpiler.passes.rzx_templates()`` function

    The ``inst_map`` argument has been removed from the following elements:

      * The :func:`.generate_preset_pass_manager` and :func:`.transpile` functions
      * The :meth:`.Target.from_configuration` method
      * The constructor of the :class:`.PassManagerConfig` class

    Calibration support has been removed:

      * ``calibration`` has been removed from the :class:`.InstructionProperties` 's constructor and is no longer a property of that class.
      * The ``has_calibration``, ``get_calibration``, ``instruction_schedule_map`` and ``update_from_instruction_schedule_map`` methods have been removed from the :class:`.Target` class.
