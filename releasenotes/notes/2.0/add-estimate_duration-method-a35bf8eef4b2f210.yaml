    Added a new circuit method, :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.estimate_duration`, to estimate the duration of 
    a scheduled circuit after transpilation. The circuit duration is estimated by finding the 
    longest path on a scheduled circuit based on the durations provided by a given :class:`.Target`. 
    This method only works for simple circuits that do not contain control flow or other classical 
    feed-forward operations.

    Use this method instead of the deprecated :attr:`.QuantumCircuit.duration` attribute if you need an estimate of the full circuit duration.

    Example usage::

      from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, transpile
      from qiskit.providers.fake_provider import GenericBackendV2

      backend = GenericBackendV2(num_qubits=3, seed=42)

      circ = QuantumCircuit(3)
      circ.cx(0, 1)
      circ.measure_all()
      circ.delay(1e15, 2)

      circuit_dt = transpile(circ, backend, scheduling_method="asap")
      duration = circuit_dt.estimate_duration(backend.target, unit="s")
      print("Estimated duration: ", duration)
