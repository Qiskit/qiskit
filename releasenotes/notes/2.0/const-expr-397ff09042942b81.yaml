    The classical realtime-expressions module :mod:`qiskit.circuit.classical` can now represent
    constant expressions. The :class:`~.expr.Expr` class now has a bool
    :attr:`~.expr.Expr.const` attribute which indicates the expression's const-ness. This allows
    us to enforce that expressions in certain contexts must be possible to evaluate at compile time.

    All :class:`~.expr.Var` expressions are considered to be non-const, while all :class:`~.expr.Value`
    expressions are const.

    An expression comprised only of other const expressions is also const::

      from qiskit.circuit.classical import expr

      assert expr.bit_and(5, 6).const

    An expression that contains any non-const expression is non-const::

      from qiskit.circuit.classical import expr, types

      assert not expr.bit_and(5, expr.Var.new("a", types.Uint(5)).const
