    Qiskit no longer supports Linux i686 and 32 bit Windows. Starting in Qiskit
    2.0 a 64 bit platform is needed to run Qiskit. The user base for 32bit
    architectures is relatively small and as Qiskit continues to focus on
    improving performance to handle the increased scale in the complexity
    of quantum computing hardware maintaining support for 32 bit platforms
    is proving increasingly difficult. This coupled with the larger
    scientific/numeric Python community's trend away from 32 bit platform
    support maintaining support for 32bit platforms is no longer viable.
    Qiskit 1.x will still continue to support 32 bit platforms, but starting
    in this 2.0.0 release Qiskit no longer supports these platforms, will
    not publish pre-compiled binaries for these platforms any longer, and
    there is no longer any guarantee of being able to build from source on
    32 bit platforms.
