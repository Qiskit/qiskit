    Qiskit v2.0 has dropped support for Linux i686 and 32-bit Windows. Starting in Qiskit
    v2.0.0, a 64-bit platform is required to run pre-compiled installations of Qiskit. 
    This aligns with the trend in the scientific Python community and allows Qiskit to 
    focus on performance improvements for increasingly complex quantum computing hardware.
    
    Qiskit v1.4 will continue to support 32-bit platforms until end-of-life (September 2025), 
    but starting in this 2.0.0 release, Qiskit will no 
    longer publish pre-compiled binaries for them, and offers no guarantee of 
    successful source builds on 32-bit platforms.
