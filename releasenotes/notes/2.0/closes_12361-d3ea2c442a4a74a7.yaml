    The ``idle_wires`` parameter in all circuit drawers has been extended with a new option, ``"auto"``, which is now
    the default behavior. If you still want to display wires without instructions, explicitly set ``idle_wires=True``.

    When set to ``"auto"``, the behavior is as follows:
    - If the circuit has a defined ``.layout`` attribute, ``idle_wires`` is automatically set to ``False`` (hiding idle wires).
    - Otherwise, ``idle_wires`` remains ``True`` (showing all wires, as previous default).

    Here an example. A circuit without a layout, using ``idle_wires="auto"``:

    .. code-block:: text

      qr_0: ────────
            ┌───┐┌─┐
      qr_1: ┤ H ├┤M├
            └───┘└╥┘
      cr_0: ══════╬═
                  ║
      cr_1: ══════╩═

    Once a layout is applied, ``idle_wires="auto"`` sets ``idle_wires`` to ``False``, hiding idle wires:

    .. code-block:: text

                ┌───┐┌─┐
      qr_1 -> 1 ┤ H ├┤M├
                └───┘└╥┘
          cr_1: ══════╩═

    If you want to display all wires in a laid-out circuit, set ``idle_wires=True`` explicitly:

    .. code-block:: text

           qr_0 -> 0 ────────
                     ┌───┐┌─┐
           qr_1 -> 1 ┤ H ├┤M├
                     └───┘└╥┘
      ancilla_0 -> 2 ──────╫─
                           ║
               cr_0: ══════╬═
                           ║
               cr_1: ══════╩═

    As quantum computers scale to more qubits, even small circuits can produce large circuit representations after
    transpilation. The ``"auto"`` setting helps improve readability by hiding unnecessary wires when possible.
