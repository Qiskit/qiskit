    The legacy scheduling passes ``ASAPSchedule``, ``ALAPSchedule``,
    ``DynamicalDecoupling``, and ``AlignMeasures`` have been removed in favor of the updated alternatives
    :class:`.ALAPScheduleAnalysis`, :class:`.ASAPScheduleAnalysis`,
    :class:`.PadDynamicalDecoupling`, and :class:`.ConstrainedReschedule` respectively.
    These were deprecated in Qiskit v1.1 after the new scheduling workflow superseded the legacy one.
