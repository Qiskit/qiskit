    The deprecated transpiler passes ``ASAPSchedule``, ``ALAPSchedule``,
    ``DynamicalDecoupling``, and ``AlignMeasures`` have been removed. These
    passes were marked as deprecated. They have been replaced by the
    :class:`.ALAPScheduleAnalysis`, :class:`.ASAPScheduleAnalysis`,
    :class:`.PadDynamicalDecoupling`, and :class:`.ConstrainedReschedule`
    passes respectively which can be used instead.
