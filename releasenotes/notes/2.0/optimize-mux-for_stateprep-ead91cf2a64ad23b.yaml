    :class:`~.library.UCGate` now includes a ``mux_simp`` boolean attribute that enables the search
    for simplifications of Carvalho et al., implemented in :meth:`~.library.UCGate._simplify`.
    This optimization, enabled by default, identifies and removes unnecessary controls from the
    multiplexer, reducing the number of CX gates and circuit depth, especially in separable
    state preparation with :class:`~.library.Initialize`.
