    The constructor for :class:`~.library.UCGate` now has a new optional argument, ``mux_simp``, which takes a boolean
    value that enables the search for simplifications of Carvalho et al.
    This optimization is enabled by default, identifies and removes unnecessary controls from the
    multiplexer, reducing the number of CX gates and circuit depth, especially in separable
    state preparation with :class:`~.library.Initialize`.
