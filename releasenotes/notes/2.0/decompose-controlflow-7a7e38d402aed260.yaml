fixes:
  - |
    Fixed a bug where calling :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.decompose` on an instruction
    that had no definition inside a ``c_if`` block would raise an error.
    Fixed `#13493 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/13493>`__.
  - |
    Fixed a bug where operations inside a control flow block (e.g. :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.for_loop`)
    were not correctly decomposed when calling :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.decompose`. This
    behavior is now fixed and instructions are properly unrolled in all cases.
    Fixed `#13544 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/13544>`__.
