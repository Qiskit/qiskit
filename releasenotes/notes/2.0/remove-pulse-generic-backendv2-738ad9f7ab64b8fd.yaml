    As part of pulse removal in Qiskit v2.0.0, pulse support has been removed from
    :class:`.GenericBackendV2`. This includes the ability to initialize the backend
    with custom calibrations (``calibrate_instructions`` argument) and pulse channel
    attributes (``drive_channel``, ``measure_channel``, ``acquire_channel``, ``control_channel``).
