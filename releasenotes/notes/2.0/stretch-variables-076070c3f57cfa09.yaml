    A new expression node :class:`~.expr.Stretch` has been added to the classical expression
    system to represent ``stretch`` variables. To create a new ``stretch` variable, you can
    use :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.add_stretch`. The resulting expression is a constant
    expression of type :class:`~.types.Duration`, which can be used as the ``duration``
    argument of a :meth:`~.QuantumCircuit.delay`.

    For example, to ensure a sequence of gates between two barriers will be
    left-aligned, whatever their actual durations are, you can do the following::

      from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
      from numpy import pi

      qc = QuantumCircuit(5)
      qc.barrier()
      qc.cx(0, 1)
      qc.u(pi/4, 0, pi/2, 2)
      qc.cx(3, 4)

      a = qc.add_stretch("a")
      b = qc.add_stretch("b")
      c = qc.add_stretch("c")

      # Use the stretches as Delay duration.
      qc.delay(a, [0, 1])
      qc.delay(b, 2)
      qc.delay(c, [3, 4])
      qc.barrier()

    The :class:`~.expr.Stretch` expression is most similar to the existing :class:`~.expr.Var`
    expression used to represent classical variables in a circuit, except it is constant and
    is always of type :class:`~.types.Duration`. It can be used in other expressions (for example,
    you can multiply it by a numeric constant) and :class:`.QuantumCircuit` provides full
    scoping support for it (for example, it can be captured by or declared within a control flow
    scope).

    For additional context and examples, refer to the 
    `OpenQASM 3 language specification. <https://openqasm.com/language/delays.html#duration-and-stretch-types>`__
