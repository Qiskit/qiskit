    Previously the :class:`.HighLevelSynthesis` transpiler pass synthesized an
    instruction for which a synthesis plugin is available, regardless of
    whether the instruction is already supported by the target or a part of
    the explicitly passed ``basis_gates``. This behavior is now fixed, so that
    such already supported instructions are no longer synthesized.
