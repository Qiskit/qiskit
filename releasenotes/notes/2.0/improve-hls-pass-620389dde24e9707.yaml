    The :class:`.HighLevelSynthesis` transpiler pass now synthesizes
    objects of type :class:`~.AnnotatedOperation` via the
    plugin interface.
upgrade_transpiler:
  - |
    In the case that neither a target nor a set of basis gates are specified,
    the :class:`.HighLevelSynthesis` transpiler pass synthesizes circuits with
    annotated operations with fewer layers of wrappings than before (this happens,
    for instance, for the circuit produced by :func:`.multiplier_cumulative_h18`).
