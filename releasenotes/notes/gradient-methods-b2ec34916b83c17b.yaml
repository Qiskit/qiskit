    :class:`.FiniteDiffEstimatorGradient` and :class:`FiniteDiffSamplerGradient`
    have new argument method.
    There are three methods, "central", "forward", and "backward".
    This option changes the gradient calculation methods.
    "central" calculates :math:`\frac{f(x+e/2)-f(x-e/2)}{e}`, "forward"
    :math:`\frac{f(x+e) - f(x)}{e}`, and "backward" :math:`\frac{f(x)-f(x-e)}{e}` where
    :math:`e` is the offset epsilon.

    :class:`.FiniteDiffEstimatorGradient` and :class:`FiniteDiffSamplerGradient`
    calculated gradients by :math:`\frac{f(x+e)-f(x-e)}{2e}`.
    Fixed to correct formula as central difference. That is, it is calculated as
    :math:`\frac{f(x+e/2)-f(x-e/2)}{e}`
