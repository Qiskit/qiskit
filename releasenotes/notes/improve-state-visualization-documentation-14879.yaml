    Improved documentation for state visualization functions to clarify numerical precision behavior.
    The :func:`~qiskit.visualization.plot_state_city` and :func:`~qiskit.visualization.plot_state_hinton`
    functions now include comprehensive explanations of why small non-zero values (typically 1e-16 to 1e-17)
    may appear when visualizing quantum states where certain components should theoretically be zero.
    This documentation clarifies that these small values represent the true computational results
    rather than errors, helping users understand the expected behavior and reducing confusion.
    The improvements include:
    
    * Enhanced module-level docstring explaining numerical precision across all visualization functions
    * Detailed "Important Note on Numerical Precision" sections in function docstrings
    * Practical examples showing how to interpret the output
    * Clear explanation that small bars representing tiny values are expected and correct
    
    This addresses GitHub issue #14879 and improves the user experience for all Qiskit users
    working with state visualizations.

    The documentation for :func:`~qiskit.visualization.plot_state_city` and related state
    visualization functions has been significantly enhanced to address user confusion about
    numerical precision. Users will now see clear explanations that small non-zero values
    in visualizations are expected behavior representing the true computational results,
    not errors or bugs. This change helps users understand what they're seeing and
    prevents false bug reports while maintaining scientific accuracy.
