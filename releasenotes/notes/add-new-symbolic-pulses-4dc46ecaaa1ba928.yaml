    The ``SymbolicPulse`` library was extended. The new pulses in the library are:

      * :fun:``~qiskit.pulse.library.Sin``
      * :fun:``~qiskit.pulse.library.Cos``
      * :fun:``~qiskit.pulse.library.Sawtooth``
      * :fun:``~qiskit.pulse.library.Triangle``

    The new functions return a ``ScalableSymbolicPulse``. With the exception of the ``Sawtooth`` phase,
    behaviour is identical to that of the corresponding waveform generators (:class:``~qiskit.pulse.library.sin`` etc).
