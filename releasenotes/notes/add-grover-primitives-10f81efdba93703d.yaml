    :class:`~.Grover` supports the primitives and can use :class:`~.BaseSampler` to
    calculate the results. Accordingly, ``quantum instance`` in :class:`~.Grover`
    is pending deprecation and will be deprecated in a future release.

    Example::
    .. code-block:: python

      sampler = Sampler(...)
      problem = AmplificationProblem(...)
      grover = Grover(sampler)
      result = grover.amplify(problem)

     Using a :class:`~.QuantumInstance` in :class:`~.Grover` is
     pending deprecation and will be deprecated in a future release. Instead, use
     a :class:`.BaseSampler` to calculate the results, see also the features of this release.
