    :class:`~.Grover` supports the primitives and can use :class:`~.Sampler` to
    calculate the results. Accordingly, ``quantum instance`` in :class:`~.Grover`
    is pending deprecation and will be deprecated in a future release.

     Using a :class:`~.QuantumInstance` in :class:`~.Grover` is
     pending deprecation and will be deprecated in a future release. Instead, use
     a :class:`.BaseSampler` to calculate the results, see also the features of this release.
