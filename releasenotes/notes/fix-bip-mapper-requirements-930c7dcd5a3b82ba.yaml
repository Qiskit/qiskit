    Fix ``pip install qiskit-terra[all]`` on Python 3.6 and 3.9.  On these
    versions, the ``bip-mapper`` target constraints cannot be satisfied due to
    the ``cplex`` package only supporting Python 3.7 and 3.8.  Requesting the
    ``all`` target on these versions will now not attempt to install the
    unsolvable dependency, though you can still attempt to install the
    ``bip-mapper`` extra directly if you want to force pip to try and resolve
    the package.
