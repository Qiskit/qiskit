    Fixed ``pip install qiskit-terra[all]`` so that it will successfully install
    when running on Python 3.6 and 3.9.  Previously, these Python versions would
    fail to install the ``all`` target because the ``bip-mapper`` extra
    requirements could not be satisfied due to the ``cplex`` package only
    supporting Python 3.7 and 3.8.  Requesting the ``all`` target on these
    Python versions will now no longer attempt to install the unsolvable
    dependency (ie ``cplex`` will not longer be attempted to installed). The
    ``bip-mapper`` extra will still attempt to install the
    ``cplex`` and ``docplex`` packages on Python 3.6 and 3.9 (and likely fail as
    ``cplex`` isn't available).
