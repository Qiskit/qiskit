    This PR now allows the pulse scaling techniques found in RZXCalibrationBuilder
    and RZXCalibrationBuilderNoEcho to consume `ecr` entangling gates from the
    backend, in addition to the `cx` gates they were build for. These native gates
    contain the calibrated pulse schedules that the pulse scaling passes use to 
    generate arbitraty rotations of the :class:`~RZXGate` operation.

    Currently the FakeSherbrooke backend does not contain `.defaults()` from which
    the instruction schedule map is obtained. The unit test `TestCalibrationBuilder` 
    requires this to check `ecr` operations work similarly to the `cx` gate case. 
    As of this PR, `ibm_sherbrooke` is the only backend with native `ecr` gates, so 
    this requires updating.
