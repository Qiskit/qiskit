    New gradient classes using the primitives has been added. They internally
    use the primitives to calculate the gradients. There are 3 types of
    gradient classes (Finite Difference, Parameter Shift, and
    Linear Combination of Unitary) for a sampler and estimator.

    Example::
    .. code-block:: python

      estimator = Estimator(...)
      gradient = ParamShiftEstimatorGradient(estimator)
      results = gradient.evaluate(circuits, observables, parameters)
