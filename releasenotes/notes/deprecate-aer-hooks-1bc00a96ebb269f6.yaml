deprecations:
  - |
    Use of the :attr:`qiskit.Aer` object is deprecated and will be removed in Qiskit 1.0.  You
    should instead use the same object from the ``qiskit_aer`` namespace, which is a drop-in
    replacement.
  - |
    Importing from ``qiskit.providers.aer`` is deprecated and will stop working in Qiskit 1.0.  You
    should instead import from ``qiskit_aer``, which is a drop-in replacement.
  - |
    Running pulse jobs on backends from :mod:`qiskit.providers.fake_provider` is deprecated, and
    all support will be removed in Qiskit 1.0.  This is due to Qiskit Aer removing its simulation
    functionality for such jobs.  For low-level Hamiltonain-simulation workloads, consider using
    a specialised library such as `Qiskit Dynamics <https://qiskit.org/ecosystem/dynamics>`__.
