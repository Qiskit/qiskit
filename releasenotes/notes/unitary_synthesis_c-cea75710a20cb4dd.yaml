    Added a new standalone transpiler pass function
    ``qk_transpiler_pass_standalone_unitary_synthesis`` which is for running
    the :class:`.UnitarySynthesis` transpiler pass. Calling this function is
    the equivalent of running the pass in Python like::

      UnitarySynthesis(..)(circuit

    with the default synthesis plugin (the C API does not support the unitary
    synthesis plugin interface).
