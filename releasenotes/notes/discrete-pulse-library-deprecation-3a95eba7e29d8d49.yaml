    The ``SymbolicPulse`` library was extended. The new pulses in the library are:

      * :func:``~qiskit.pulse.library.GaussianDeriv``
      * :func:``~qiskit.pulse.library.Sech``
      * :func:``~qiskit.pulse.library.SechDeriv``
      * :func:``~qiskit.pulse.library.Square``

    The new functions return a ``ScalableSymbolicPulse``, and match the functionality
    of the corresponding functions in the discrete pulse library, with the exception of
    ``Square()`` which uses the convention ``sign(0)=0`` instead of ``sign(0)=1`` in
    the discrete ``square()``.
