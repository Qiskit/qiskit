    The :class:`~qiskit.pulse.SymbolicPulse` library was extended. The new pulses in the library are:

      * :func:`~qiskit.pulse.library.GaussianDeriv`
      * :func:`~qiskit.pulse.library.Sech`
      * :func:`~qiskit.pulse.library.SechDeriv`
      * :func:`~qiskit.pulse.library.Square`

    The new functions return a :class:`ScalableSymbolicPulse`, and match the functionality
    of the corresponding functions in the discrete pulse library, with the exception of
    `Square()` for which a phase of :math:`2\\pi` shifts by a full cycle (contrary to the
    discrete `square()` where such a shift was induced by a :math:`\\pi` phase).
