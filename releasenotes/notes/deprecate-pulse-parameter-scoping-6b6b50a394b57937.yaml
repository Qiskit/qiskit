deprecations:
  - |
    The :meth:`.ScheduleBlock.scoped_parameters` and
    :meth:`.ScheduleBlock.search_parameters` methods have been deprecated.
    These methods produce :class:`.Parameter` objects with names modified to
    indicate pulse scoping. The original intention of the methods was that
    these objects would still link to the original unscoped :class:`.Parameter`
    objects. However, the modification of the name breaks the link so that
    assigning using the scoped version does not work. See `#11654
    <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/11654>`__ for more context.
