    Disassembled circuits now inherit calibrations from assembled qobj and experiment.
    :func:`~_qobj_to_circuit_cals(qobj_cals)` parses qobj and experiment calibrations
    into the circuit calibration dict structure. :func:`~_experiments_to_circuits`
    sets circuit calibrations, first from qobj-level and second from experiment-level
    if calibrations were assigned.
