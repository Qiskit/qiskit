    Adds the :meth:`.PauliList.noncommutation_graph` and
    :meth:`.SparsePauliOp.noncommutation_graph` methods, exposing the
    construction of non-commutation graphs, recasting the measurement operator
    grouping problem into a graph coloring problem. This permits users to work
    with these graphs directly, for example to explore coloring algorithms other
    than the one used by :meth:`.SparsePauliOp.group_commuting`.
