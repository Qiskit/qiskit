fixes:

    The ``append`` method can be used to insert one parameterized
    gate instance into multiple circuits. This fix makes a copy
    of parameterized gate instances when appended to a circuit 
    to ensure that changing a parameter in one circuit will 
    not affect other circuits.

    Behavioral change: Altering a parameterized gate instance 
    after being placed in a circuit will no longer affect the 
    gate in said circuit. In other words, the parameterized 
    gate object created outside of the circuit will not match 
    the object placed in the circuit.
