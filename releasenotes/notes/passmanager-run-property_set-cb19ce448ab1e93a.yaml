    Passing ``property_set`` as an arbitrary keyword argument to the :meth:`~.BasePassManager.run`
    method of a subclass of :class:`.BasePassManager` will change behavior in Qiskit 2.0.  It is
    currently forwarded to the internal representation converting functions of the pass manager, as
    is any arbitrary keyword argument to that method.  Starting from Qiskit 2.0, the option will
    instead be used to set the seed of the :class:`.PropertySet` for the pipeline run, and the
    argument will not be passed to the conversion functions.

    This note only concerns implementers of subclasses of :class:`.BasePassManager` who have chosen
    their ``_passmanager_frontend`` and ``_passmanager_backend`` implementations to accept a keyword
    argument called ``property_set``.
