    The :class:`.DAGCircuit` methods :meth:`~.DAGCircuit.apply_operation_back` and
    :meth:`~.DAGCircuit.apply_operation_front` have gained a ``check`` keyword argument that can be
    set ``False`` to skip validation that the inputs uphold the :class:`.DAGCircuit` data-structure
    invariants.  This is useful as a performance optimisation when the DAG is being built from
    known-good data, such as during transpiler passes.
