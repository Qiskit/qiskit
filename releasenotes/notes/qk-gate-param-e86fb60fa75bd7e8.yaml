    Added support to add parameterized gates to circuits using the new
    ``qk_circuit_gate_param`` function, which specifies the gate parameters as
    ``QkParam *`` objects. For example:

    .. code-block:: c

      QkCircuit *qc = qk_circuit_new(100, 0);
      QkParam *theta = qk_param_new_symbol("theta");
      uint32_t qubit[1] = {0};
      const QkParam* params[1] = {theta};
      qk_circuit_gate_param(qc, QkGate_RX, qubit, params); // add RX(theta) to the circuit

  - |
    Added ``qk_circuit_num_symbols`` to query the number of unbound symbols present
    in the circuit.
upgrade_c:
  - |
    ``QkInstruction.params`` was upgraded from a pointer to ``double`` to a pointer
    to ``const QkParam *`` objects. This change happened because gate parameters in the
    C API are no longer restricted to fixed numeric values, but may also be parameterized
    expressions with unbound symbols, which are represented by a ``QkParam *``.
