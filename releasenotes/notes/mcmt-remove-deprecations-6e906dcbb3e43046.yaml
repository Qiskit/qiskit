upgrade_circuits:
  - Removed ``MCMT`` and ``MCMTVChain``, which have been deprecated since Qiskit v1.3.
    The :class:`.MCMTGate` can be used instead.
  - Removed support for passing single-qubit single-controlled gates to :class:`.MCMTGate`,
    which has been deprecated since Qiskit v1.3. Instead, pass the single-qubit gate without
    control. For example, instead of ``MCMTGate(CXGate())`` use ``MCMTGate(XGate())``.
