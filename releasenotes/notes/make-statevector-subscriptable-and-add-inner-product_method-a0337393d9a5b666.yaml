features:
  - |
    Make :class:`~qiskit.quantum_info.Statevector` subscriptable.
    User can now retrieve the nth element in a :class:`~qiskit.quantum_info.Statevector` by index as ``statevec[n]``.

    See `#4916 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/4916>`__ from more information.

  - |
    Add inner product method to :class:`~qiskit.quantum_info.Statevector`.
    It takes as input another statevector and outputs the inner product.

    For example::

      statevec_inner_other = statevec.inner(other)

    See `#4934 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/4934>`__ from more information.
