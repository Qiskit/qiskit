    Make :class:`qiskit.quantum_info.states.statevector.Statevector` subscriptable.
    User can now retrieve the i-th elementh in a Statevector by index as statevec[i].

    See `#4916 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/4916>`__ from more information.

    Add inner product method to :class:`qiskit.quantum_info.states.statevector.Statevector`.
    It takes as imput an other statevector an outputs the inner product.

    For example::
      statevec_inner_other = statevec.inner(other)

    See `#4934 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/4934>`__ from more information.
