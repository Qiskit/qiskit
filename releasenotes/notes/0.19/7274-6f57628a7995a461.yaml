    In this version, ``from qiskit import *`` will not import submodules, but only a selected list of objects.
    This might break existing code using ``from qiskit import *`` and referring to objects that are not part of the current namespace.
    As a reminder, ``import *`` is  considered bad practice and it should not be used in production code.
    Qiskit sets ``__all__`` in ``qiskit/__init__.py`` as a way to mitigate the effects of said bad practice.
    If your code raises ``name '<something>' is not defined``, add ``from qiskit import <something>`` and try again.
