    Starting with this version, ``from qiskit import *`` will not import submodules, but
    only a selected list of objects.  This might break existing code using
    ``from qiskit import *`` and referring to objects that are not part of the
    current namespace.  As a reminder, ``import *`` is  considered bad practice
    and it should not be used in production code.  Qiskit sets ``__all__`` in
    ``qiskit/__init__.py`` as a way to mitigate the effects of said bad
    practice.  If your code raises ``name '<something>' is not defined``, add
    ``from qiskit import <something>`` and try again.
