    Added a new method :meth:`.PauliList.group_qubit_wise_commuting` that
    partitions a :obj:`.PauliList` into sets of mutually qubit-wise commuting
    :obj:`.Pauli` operators.  For example::
      
      from qiskit.quantum_info import PauliList, Pauli
      pauli_list = PauliList([Pauli("IY"), Pauli("XX"), Pauli("YY"), Pauli("YX")])
      pauli_list.group_qubit_wise_commuting()
