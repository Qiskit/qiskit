    Added a new function,  `group_qubit_wise_commuting()`, which partitions a 
    ``PauliList`` into sets of mutually qubit-wise commuting ``Pauli`` strings.
    for example::
      
      from qiskit.quantum_info import PauliList,Pauli
      pauli_list=PauliList([Pauli("IY"), Pauli("XX"),Pauli("YY"),Pauli("YX")])
      pauli_list.group_qubit_wise_commuting()
