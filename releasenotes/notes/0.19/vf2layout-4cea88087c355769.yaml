    Added a new transpiler pass, :class:`~qiskit.transpiler.passes.VF2Layout`.
    This pass models the layout allocation problem as a subgraph isomorphism
    problem and uses the `VF2 algorithm`_ implementation in `retworkx
    <https://qiskit.org/documentation/retworkx/stubs/retworkx.vf2_mapping.html>`__
    to find a perfect layout (a layout which would not require additional
    routing) if one exists. The functionality exposed by this new pass is very
    similar to exisiting :class:`~qiskit.transpiler.passes.CSPLayout` but
    :class:`~qiskit.transpiler.passes.VF2Layout` is significantly faster.
