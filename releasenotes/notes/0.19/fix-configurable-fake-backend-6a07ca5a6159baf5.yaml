    The member ``name`` of ``qiskit.test.mock.utils.ConfigurableFakeBackend``
    has been changed to ``backend_name``. This was done to avoid a conflict with the
    :meth:`~qiskit.providers.BackendV1.name` method inherited from the parent abstract
    :class:`~qiskit.providers.BackendV1` class. This makes
    ``ConfigurableFakeBackend`` compatible with anything expecting a
    :class:`~qiskit.providers.BackendV1` object. However, if you were using the
    ``name`` attribute directly before you will now need to either call it as a method or
    access the ``backend_name`` attribute instead.
    in several unittests because string is not callable.
