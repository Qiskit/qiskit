    Added a new transpiler pass,
    :class:`~qiskit.transpiler.passes.CollectMultiQBlocks`, to the
    :mod:`qiskit.transpiler.passes` module. This pass is used to collect
    sequences of uninterrupted gates acting on groups of qubits. It provides
    a similar function to the existing
    :class:`~qiskit.transpiler.passes.Collect2qBlocks` pass, but while that
    pass is designed and optimized to find 2 qubit blocks this new pass will
    work to find blocks of any size.
