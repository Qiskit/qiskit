    Added a new parameter, ``add_bits``, to :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.measure_all`.
    By default it is set to ``True`` to maintain the previous behavior of adding a new :obj:`.ClassicalRegister` of the same size as the number of qubits to store the measurements.
    If set to ``False``, the measurements will be stored in the already existing classical bits.
    For example, if you created a circuit with existing classical bits like::
    
        from qiskit.circuit import QuantumCircuit, QuantumRegister, ClassicalRegister
        
        qr = QuantumRegister(2)
        cr = ClassicalRegister(2, "meas")
        circuit = QuantumCircuit(qr, cr)

    calling ``circuit.measure_all(add_bits=False)`` will use the existing
    classical register ``cr`` as the output target of the
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.Measurement` objects added to the circuit.
