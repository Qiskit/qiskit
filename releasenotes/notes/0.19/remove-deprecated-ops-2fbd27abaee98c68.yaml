    The use of ``*`` (``__mul__``) for the
    :meth:`~qiskit.quantum_info.Operator.dot` method and ``@`` (``__matmul__``)
    for the :meth:`~qiskit.quantum_info.Operator.compose` method of
    ``BaseOperator`` (which is the parent of all the operator classes in
    :mod:`qiskit.quantum_info` including classes like
    :class:`~qiskit.quantum_info.Operator` and
    :class:`~qiskit.quantum_info.Pauli`) is no longer supported.  The use of
    these operators were previously deprecated in 0.17.0 release.  Instead you
    should use the :meth:`~qiskit.quantum_info.Operator.dot` and
    :meth:`~qiskit.quantum_info.Operator.compose` methods directly, or the ``&``
    operator (``__and__``) can be used for
    :meth:`~qiskit.quantum_info.Operator.compose`.  For example, if you were
    previously using the operator like::

        from qiskit.quantum_info import random_hermitian

        op_a = random_hermitian(4)
        op_b = random_hermitian(4)

        new_op = op_a @ op_b

    this should be changed to be::

        from qiskit.quantum_info import random_hermitian

        op_a = random_hermitian(4)
        op_b = random_hermitian(4)
        new_op = op_a.compose(op_b)

    or::

        new_op = op_a & op_b
