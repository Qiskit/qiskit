    The OpenQASM 3 export capabilities are in a beta state, and some features of
    Qiskit Terra's :obj:`.QuantumCircuit` are not yet supported.  In particular, you
    may see errors if you try to export custom subroutines with classical
    parameters, and there is no provision yet for exporting pulse-calibrated
    operations into `OpenPulse <https://qiskit.github.io/openqasm/language/openpulse.html>`__.
