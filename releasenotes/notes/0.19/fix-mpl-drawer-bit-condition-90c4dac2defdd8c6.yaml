    The ``"mpl"`` output method for the :func:`~qiskit.visualization.circuit_drawer`
    function and the :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.draw` method can now 
    draw circuits that contain gates with single bit condition. This was added for
    compatibility of the ``"mpl"`` drawer with the new feature of supporting classical 
    conditioning of gates on single classical bits.
