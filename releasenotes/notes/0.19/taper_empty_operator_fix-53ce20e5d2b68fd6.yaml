    When tapering an empty/zero operator, the code, on detecting it was zero, logged a
    warning and returned the original operator.  Such operators are commonly found in
    the auxiliary operators, when using Qiskit Nature, and the above behavior caused VQE
    to throw an exception as tapered non-zero operators were a different number of qubits
    from the tapered zero operators (since taper has returned the input operator unchanged).
    The code will now correctly taper a zero operator such that the number of qubits is
    reduced as expected and matches to tapered non-zero operators e.g 0*"IIII" when we are
    tapering by 3 qubits will become 0*"I".
