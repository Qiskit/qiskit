    When tapering an empty zero operator in :mod:`qiskit.opflow`, the code, on detecting it was
    zero, logged a warning and returned the original operator.  Such operators are commonly found in
    the auxiliary operators, when using Qiskit Nature, and the above behavior caused
    :obj:`~qiskit.algorithms.minimimum_eigen_solvers.VQE` to throw an exception as tapered non-zero
    operators were a different number of qubits from the tapered zero operators (since taper has
    returned the input operator unchanged). The code will now correctly taper a zero operator such
    that the number of qubits is reduced as expected and matches to tapered non-zero operators e.g
    ```0*"IIII"``` when we are tapering by 3 qubits will become ``0*"I"``.
