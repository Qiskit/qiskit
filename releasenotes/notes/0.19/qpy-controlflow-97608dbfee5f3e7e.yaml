fixes:
  - |
    Fixed QPY serialization of :class:`.QuantumCircuit` objects that contained
    control flow instructions. Previously if you attempted to serialize a
    circuit containing :class:`.IfElseOp`, :class:`.WhileLoopOp`, or
    :class:`.ForLoopOp` the serialization would fail.
    Fixed `#7583 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/7583>`__.
  - |
    Fixed QPY serialization of :class:`.QuantumCircuit` containing subsets of
    bits from a :class:`.QuantumRegister` or :class:`.ClassicalRegister`.
    Previously if you tried to serialize a circuit like this it would
    incorrectly treat these bits as standalone :class:`.Qubit` or
    :class:`.Clbit` without having a register set. For example, if you try to
    serialize a circuit like::

        import io
        from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, QuantumRegister
        from qiskit.circuit.qpy_serialization import load, dump

        qr = QuantumRegister(2)
        qc = QuantumCircuit([qr[0]])
        qc.x(0)
        with open('file.qpy', 'wb') as fd:
            dump(qc, fd)

    when that circuit is loaded now the registers will be correctly populated
    fully even though the circuit only contains a subset of the bits from the
    register.
