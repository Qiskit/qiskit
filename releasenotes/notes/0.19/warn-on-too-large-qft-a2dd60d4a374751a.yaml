    :class:`.QFT` will now warn if it is instantiated or built with settings
    that will cause it to lose precision, rather than raising an
    ``OverflowError``.  This can happen if the number of qubits is very large
    (slightly over 1000) without the approximation degree being similarly large.
    The circuit will now build successfully, but some angles might be
    indistinguishable from zero, due to limitations in double-precision
    floating-point numbers.
