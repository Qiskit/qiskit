    The internal use of the random number generator in
    :func:`~qiskit.circuit.random.random_circuit` was adjusted, which will
    change the output from previous versions, even with a fixed seed. This was
    done to greatly improve the runtime scaling with the number of qubits being
    used. If you were depending on an identical output from a previous version
    it is recommended that you use
    :func:`.qpy_serialization.dump` to save the random
    circuit generated with a previous version and instead of re-generating it
    with the new release, and instead just use
    :func:`.qpy_serialization.load` to load that saved circuit.
