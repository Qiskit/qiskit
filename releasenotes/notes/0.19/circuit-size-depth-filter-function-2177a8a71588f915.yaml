    Added a ``filter_function`` argument to
    :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.depth` and  
    :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.size` in order to
    analyze circuit operations according to some criteria.

    For example, to get the number of two-qubit gates, you can do::

      circuit.size(lambda x: x[0].num_qubits == 2)

    Or to get the depth of T gates acting on the zeroth qubit::

      circuit.depth(lambda x: x[0].name == 't' and circuit.qubits[0] in x[1])
