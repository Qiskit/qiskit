    The :obj:`~qiskit.algorithms.eigen_solvers.Eigensolver` and
    :obj:`~qiskit.algorithms.minimimum_eigen_solvers.MinimumEigensolver` interfaces now support the type
    ``Dict[str, Optional[OperatorBase]]`` for the ``aux_operators`` parameter in their respective
    :meth:`~qiskit.algorithms.eigen_solvers.Eigensolver.compute_eigenvalues` and
    :meth:`~qiskit.algorithms.minimimum_eigen_solvers.MinimumEigensolver.compute_minimum_eigenvalue` methods.
    In this case, the auxiliary eigenvalues are also stored in a dictionary under the same keys
    provided by the ``aux_operators`` dictionary. Keys that correspond to an operator that does not commute
    with the main operator are dropped.
