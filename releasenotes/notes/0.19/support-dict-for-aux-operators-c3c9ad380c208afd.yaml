    The :obj:`.Eigensolver` and :obj:`.MinimumEigensolver` interfaces now support the type
    ``Dict[str, Optional[OperatorBase]]`` for the ``aux_operators`` parameter in their respective
    :meth:`~.Eigensolver.compute_eigenvalues` and :meth:`~.MinimumEigensolver.compute_minimum_eigenvalue` methods.
    In this case, the auxiliary eigenvalues are also stored in a dictionary under the same keys
    provided by the ``aux_operators`` dictionary. Keys that correspond to an operator that does not commute
    with the main operator are dropped.
