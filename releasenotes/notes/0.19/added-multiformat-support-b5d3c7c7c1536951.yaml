    Using ``QuantumCircuit.draw()`` function with ``latex`` will now generate the file
    in the correct image format determined from the filename extension,
    for example::

      import qiskit

      circuit = qiskit.QuantumCircuit(2)
      circuit.h(0)
      circuit.cx(0, 1)
      circuit.draw('latex', filename='./file.jpg')
    
    This will save the circuit in the JPEG format (earlier it always used to save it in PNG).
    Refer to `#6448 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/6448>` for more details.

    Now, if it encountered a filename extension which is not supported,

    for example::
      
      circuit.draw('latex', filename='./file.spooky')

    It will give user a `ValueError` to change the filename extension to a supported image format::

      "ERROR: This image format is not supported. Please change file extension to a supported image format."
    
    Similarly, if a user tries to save a file using the ``text`` option in ``QuantumCircuit.draw()`` 
    without using a ``.txt`` filename extension, another `ValueError` will be thrown.

    for example::

      circuit.draw('text', filename'./file.nottxt')
    
    will generate::

      "ERROR: Filename extension is not .txt. Please use a .txt file extension to save in text format."
