    Using :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.draw` with the ``latex`` drawer will now generate a file
    in an image format inferred from the filename extension, for example::

      import qiskit

      circuit = qiskit.QuantumCircuit(2)
      circuit.h(0)
      circuit.cx(0, 1)
      circuit.draw('latex', filename='./file.jpg')
    
    This will save the circuit in the JPEG format (earlier it always used to save it in PNG).
    Refer to `#6448 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/6448>`__ for more details.

    Now, if it encounters a filename extension which is not supported, for example::
      
      circuit.draw('latex', filename='./file.spooky')

    it will give user a ``ValueError`` to change the filename extension to a supported image format.
    A similar ``ValueError`` is raised if a user tries to save the output of the ``text`` drawer to a file without using a ``.txt`` extension.
