    Using :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.draw` or :func:`.circuit_drawer` with the
    ``latex`` drawer will now generate a file in an image format inferred from the
    filename extension, for example::

      import qiskit

      circuit = qiskit.QuantumCircuit(2)
      circuit.h(0)
      circuit.cx(0, 1)
      circuit.draw('latex', filename='./file.jpg')
    
    This will save the circuit drawing in the JPEG format.  Previously, the
    image always be in PNG format.  Refer to `#6448
    <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/6448>`__ for more details.

    Now, if it encounters a filename extension which is not supported, for example::
      
      circuit.draw('latex', filename='./file.spooky')

    it will raise a ``ValueError`` to change the filename extension to a supported image format.
upgrade:
  - |
    The circuit drawers :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.draw` and
    :func:`.circuit_drawer` with the ``latex`` option will now save their images
    in a format determined the file extension (if a file name is provided).
    Previously, they would always save in PNG format.  They now raise
    ``ValueError`` if the image format is not known.  This was done to make it
    easier to save the image in different formats.
