upgrade:
  - |
    The deprecated argument ``param_dict`` of the
    :meth:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.assign_parameters` method of the
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit` class has been removed and no
    longer exists. This argument was deprecated as part of the 0.17.0 release.
    Instead you should use the ``parameters`` argument on the method.
  - |
    The deprecated argument ``value_dict``
    of the :meth:`qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.bind_parameters` method of the
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit` class has been removed and no
    longer exist. These arguments were deprecated as part of the 0.17.0 release.
    Instead you should use the ``values`` argument on the method.
fixes:
  - |
    Fix the statement about the parameter order if the parameters are provided as
    iterable and not dictionary in
    :meth:`qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.assign_parameters`. The parameters are not
    sorted by insertion but by name, with the special case that the order of a
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.ParameterVector` is maintained.
