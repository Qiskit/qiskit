    This release introduces a decomposition method for two-qubit gates which
    targets user-defined sets of RZX gates.  Transpiler users can enable
    decomposition for {``RZX(pi/2)``, ``RZX(pi/4)``, and ``RZX(pi/6)``} specifically by including
    ``'rzx'`` in their ``basis_gates`` list when calling
    :func:`~qiskit.compiler.transpile`.  Quantum information package users can
    find the method itself under the :obj:`.XXDecomposer` class.
