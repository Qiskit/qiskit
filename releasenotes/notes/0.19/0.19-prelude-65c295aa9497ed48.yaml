    The Qiskit Terra 0.19 release highlights are:

    * A new version of the abstract Qiskit/hardware interface, in the form of
      :class:`.BackendV2`, which comes with a new data structure
      :class:`~.transpiler.Target` to allow backends to better model their
      constraints for the :ref:`transpiler <qiskit-transpiler>`.

    * An :ref:`extensible plugin interface <qiskit-transpiler-plugins>` to the
      :class:`~.passes.UnitarySynthesis` transpiler pass, allowing users or
      other packages to extend Qiskit Terra's
      synthesis routines with new methods.

    * Control-flow instructions, for representing ``for`` and ``while`` loops
      and ``if``/``else`` statements in :class:`.QuantumCircuit`.  The
      simulators in Qiskit Aer will soon be able to work with these new
      instructions, allowing you to write more dynamic quantum programs.

    * Preliminary support for the evolving `OpenQASM 3 specification`_.  You can
      use the new :mod:`qiskit.qasm3` module to serialize your
      :class:`.QuantumCircuit`\ s into OpenQASM 3, including the new control-flow
      constructs.

    .. _OpenQASM 3 specification: https://qiskit.github.io/openqasm/

    This release marks the end of support for Python 3.6 in Qiskit.  This
    release of Qiskit Terra, and any subsequent bugfix releases in the 0.19.x
    series, will be the last to work with Python 3.6.  Starting from the next
    minor release (0.20.0) of Qiskit Terra, the minimum required Python version
    will be 3.7.

    As always, there are many more features and fixes in this release as well,
    which you can read about below.
