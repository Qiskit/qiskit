    The default routing pass and layout pass for transpiler optimization level 3 has
    changed to use :class:`~qiskit.transpiler.passes.SabreSwap` and
    :class:`~qiskit.transpiler.passes.SabreLayout` respectively. This
    was done to improve the quality of the output result, as using the sabre
    passes produces better results than using
    :class:`~qiskit.transpiler.passes.StochasticSwap` and
    :class:`~qiskit.transpiler.passes.DenseLayout`, which were used as the
    defaults in prior releases. This change will improve the quality of the
    results when running :func:`~qiskit.compiler.transpile` or
    :func:`~qiskit.execute_function.execute` functions with the
    ``optimization_level`` kwarg set to ``3``. While this is generally an
    improvement, if you need to retain the previous behavior for any reason
    you can do this by explicitly setting the ``routing_method="stochastic"``
    and ``layout_method="dense"`` when calling
    :func:`~qiskit.compiler.transpile` with ``optimization_level=3``.
