    The ``latex`` output method for the :func:`~qiskit.visualization.circuit_drawer`
    function and the :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.draw` method can now 
    draw circuits that contain gates with single bit condition. This was added for
    compatibility of latex drawer with the new feature of supporting classical 
    conditioning of gates on single classical bits.
