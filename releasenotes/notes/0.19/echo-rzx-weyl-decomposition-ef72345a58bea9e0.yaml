   Added a new transpiler pass :class:`.EchoRZXWeylDecomposition` that allows
   users to decompose an arbitrary two-qubit gate in terms of echoed RZX-gates
   by leveraging Cartan's decomposition.  In combination with other transpiler
   passes, this can be used to transpile arbitrary circuits to RZX-gate-based
   and pulse-efficient circuits that implement the same unitary.
