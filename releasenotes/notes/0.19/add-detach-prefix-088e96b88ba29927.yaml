    Added a utility function :func:`qiskit.utils.detach_prefix` that is a
    counterpart of :func:`~qiskit.utils.apply_prefix`.  The new function returns
    a tuple of scaled value and prefix from a given float value.  For example, a
    value ``1.3e8`` will be converted into ``(130, "M")`` that can be used to
    display a value in the user friendly format, such as ``130 MHz``.
