deprecations:
  - |
    Importing the ``qiskit.util`` module will now issue a ``DeprecationWarning``.
    Users should instead import all the same functionality from :obj:`qiskit.utils`.
    The ``util`` module has been deprecated since Terra 0.17, but previously did not issue a warning.
    It will be removed in Terra 0.20.
