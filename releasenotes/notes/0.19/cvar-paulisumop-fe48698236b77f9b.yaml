    Fixed a bug where the :class:`.CVaRMeasurement` attempted to convert a
    :class:`.PauliSumOp` to a dense matrix to check whether it were diagonal.
    For large operators (> 16 qubits) this computation was extremely expensive and raised
    an error if not explicitly enabled using ``qiskit.utils.algorithm_globals.massive = True``.
    The check is now efficient even for large numbers of qubits.
