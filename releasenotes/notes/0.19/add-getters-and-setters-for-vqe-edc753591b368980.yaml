features:
  - |
    Every attribute of the :class:`~qiskit.algorithms.VQE` class that is set at
    the initialization is now accessible with getters and setters. Further, the
    default values of the VQE attributes :attr:`~.VQE.ansatz` and
    :attr:`~.VQE.optimizer` can be reset by assigning ``None`` to them::
    
        vqe = VQE(my_ansatz, my_optimizer)
        vqe.ansatz = None   # reset to default: RealAmplitudes ansatz
        vqe.optimizer = None  # reset to default: SLSQP optimizer

fixes:
  - |
    Fixed setting the ``ansatz`` or ``optimizer`` attributes of a
    :obj:`~qiskit.algorithms.VQE` instance to ``None`` resulting in a buggy
    behavior.  See `#7093
    <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/7093>`__ for details.

upgrade:
  - |
    The ``sort_parameters_by_name`` of the :class:`~qiskit.algorithms.VQE` class
    has been removed, following its deprecation in Qiskit Terra 0.18.  There is
    no alternative provided, as the new ordering of parameters is the more
    natural sort order.
