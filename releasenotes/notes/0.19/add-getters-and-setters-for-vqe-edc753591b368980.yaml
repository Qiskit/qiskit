features:
  - |
    Every attribute of the :class:`~qiskit.algorithms.VQE` class that is set at the initialization is now
    accessible with getters and setters. Further, the default values of the VQE attributes such as ``ansatz``,
    ``optimizer`` or ``quantum_instance`` can be reset by setting the attribute to ``None``.
    
    .. code-block:: python
    
        vqe = VQE(my_ansatz, my_optimizer)
        vqe.ansatz = None   # reset to default: RealAmplitudes ansatz
        vqe.optimizer = None  # reset to default: SLSQP optimizer

fixes:
  - |
    Fixed setting the ``ansatz`` or ``optimizer`` attributes of a :obj:`~qiskit.algorithms.VQE` instance to ``None`` resulting in a buggy behavior.
    See `#7093 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/7093>`__ for details.

upgrade:
  - |
    The ``sort_parameters_by_name`` of the :class:`~qiskit.algorithms.VQE` class has been removed, following its deprecation on July 12th, 2021.
