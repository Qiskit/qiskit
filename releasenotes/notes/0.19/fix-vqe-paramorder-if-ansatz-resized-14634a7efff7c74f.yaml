    Fixed a bug in :class:`~qiskit.algorithms.VQE` where the parameters of the ansatz were 
    still explicitly ASCII-sorted by their name if the ansatz was resized. This led to a 
    mismatched order of the optimized values in the ``optimal_point`` attribute of the result
    object.

    In particular, this bug occurred if no ansatz was set by the user and the VQE chose 
    a default with 11 or more free parameters.
