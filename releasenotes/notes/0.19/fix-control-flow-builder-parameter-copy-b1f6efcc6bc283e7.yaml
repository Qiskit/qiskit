    Fixed an issue where calling :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.copy` on the "body"
    circuits of a control-flow operation created with the builder interface
    would raise an error.  For example, this was previously an error, but will
    now return successfully::

        from qiskit.circuit import QuantumCircuit, QuantumRegister, ClassicalRegister

        qreg = QuantumRegister(4)
        creg = ClassicalRegister(1)
        circ = QuantumCircuit(qreg, creg)

        with circ.if_test((creg, 0)):
            circ.h(0)

        if_else_instruction, _, _ = circ.data[0]
        true_body = if_else_instruction.params[0]
        true_body.copy()
