fixes:
  - |
    Fixed an issue where trying to display registerless bits would cause a
    failure of the ``mpl`` and the ``latex`` circuit drawers. A leading ``_``
    has been removed from the display of registerless bits' numbers in the
    ``text`` drawer.  Fixed `#6732
    <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/6732>`__.

  - |
    For one-bit registers, all of the circuit drawers now display only
    the register name and no longer show the ``0`` subscript.
    Fixed `#5784 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/5784>`__.
