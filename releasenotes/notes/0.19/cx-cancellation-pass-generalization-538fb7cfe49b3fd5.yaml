    Introduced a new transpiler pass :obj:`.InverseCancellation` that generalizes the :obj:`.CXCancellation` 
    pass to cancel any self-inverse gates or gate-inverse pairs. It can be used by 
    initializing :obj:`.InverseCancellation` and passing a gate to cancel, for example::

      from qiskit.transpiler.passes import InverseCancellation
      from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
      from qiskit.circuit.library import HGate
      from qiskit.transpiler import PassManager

      qc = QuantumCircuit(2, 2)
      qc.h(0)
      qc.h(0)
      pass_ = InverseCancellation([HGate()])
      pm = PassManager(pass_)
      new_circ = pm.run(qc)
