    Fixed an issue with the :func:`~qiskit.visualization.circuit_drawer`
    function and :meth:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.draw` method of
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit`. When displaying a ``measure``
    instruction targeted on a classical bit instead of a register, using
    the ``latex`` drawer option, the drawer would fail.

    function and :meth:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.draw` method of
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit`. With any of the 3 drawer
    options, ``mpl``, ``latex``, or ``text``, if a gate with a classical
    condition was encountered that was conditioned on a classical bit
    without a register, the drawer would fail.

    and the bit that the measure targeted did not have a register, the
    drawer would fail.
