    Fixed the :meth:`.PauliEvolutionGate.inverse` method, which previously
    computed the inverse by inverting the evolution time.  This was only the
    correct inverse if the operator was evolved exactly. In particular, this
    led to the inverse of Trotterization-based time evolutions being incorrect.
