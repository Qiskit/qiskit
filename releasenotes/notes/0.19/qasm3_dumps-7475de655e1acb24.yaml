    Qiskit Terra now has initial support for serializing
    :class:`.QuantumCircuit`\ s to `OpenQASM 3 <https://github.com/Qiskit/openqasm>`__:

    .. jupyter-execute::

            from qiskit.circuit import QuantumCircuit, QuantumRegister, ClassicalRegister
            from qiskit import qasm3

            qc = QuantumCircuit(2)
            qc.h(0)
            qc.cx(0, 1)

            print(qasm3.dumps(qc))

    This initial release has limited support for named registers, basic builtin
    instructions (such as measure, barrier and reset), user-defined gates,
    user-defined instructions (as subroutines), and opaque gates/instructions as
    ``defcal``.

    .. jupyter-execute::

        composite_circ_qreg = QuantumRegister(2)
        composite_circ = QuantumCircuit(composite_circ_qreg, name="composite_circ")
        composite_circ.h(0)
        composite_circ.x(1)
        composite_circ.cx(0, 1)
        composite_circ_gate = composite_circ.to_gate()

        qr = QuantumRegister(2, "qr")
        cr = ClassicalRegister(2, "cr")
        qc = QuantumCircuit(qr, cr)
        qc.h(0)
        qc.cx(0, 1)
        qc.barrier()
        qc.append(composite_circ_gate, [0, 1])
        qc.measure([0, 1], [0, 1])

        print(qasm3.dumps(qc))
