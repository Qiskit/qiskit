    Fixed the :mod:`~qiskit.circuit.qpy_serialization` support for serializing
    a :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.PauliEvolutionGate` object. Previously,
    the :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.PauliEvolutionGate` was treated as
    a custom gate for serialization and would be deserialized as a
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.Gate` object that had the same definition and
    name as the original :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.PauliEvolutionGate`.
    However, this would lose the original state from the
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.PauliEvolutionGate`. This has been fixed
    so that starting in this release a
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.PauliEvolutionGate` in the circuit will
    be preserved 1:1 across QPY serialization now. The only limitation with
    this is that it does not support custom
    :class:`~qiskit.synthesis.EvolutionSynthesis` classes. Only the classes
    available from :mod:`qiskit.synthesis` can be used with a
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.PauliEvolutionGate` for qpy serialization.

    To fix this issue a new QPY format version, :ref:`qpy_version_3`, was required.
    This new format version includes a representation of the
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.PauliEvolutionGate` class which is
    described in the :mod:`~qiskit.circuit.qpy_serialization` documentation at
    :ref:`pauli_evo_qpy`.
