    The string cast for :class:`qiskit.circuit.ParameterExpression` does not
    have full precision anymore. This removes the trailing 0s when printing
    parameters that are bound to floats.  This has consequences for QASM
    serialization and the circuit text drawer::

      >>> from qiskit.circuit import Parameter
      >>> x = Parameter('x')
      >>> str(x.bind({x:0.5}))
      '0.5'   # instead of '0.500000000000000'
