fixes:
  - |
    Fixed an issue where :meth:`.QAOA.construct_circuit` with different
    operators with same number of qubits would generate the same circuit each
    time.  See `#7223 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/7223>`__
    for more detail.

    Fixed an issue where :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.QAOAAnsatz` had an
    incorrect number of parameters if identities of
    :class:`~qiskit.opflow.PauliSumOp` were given, e.g.,
    ``PauliSumOp.from_list([("III", 1)])``.  See `#7225
    <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/pull/7225>`__ for more detail.
