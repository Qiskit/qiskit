    Introduced a new unitary synthesis plugin interface which is used to enable
    using alternative synthesis techniques included in external packages
    seamlessly with the :class:`~qiskit.transpiler.passes.UnitarySynthesis`
    transpiler pass. Users can select a plugin to use when calling
    :func:`~qiskit.compiler.transpile` by setting the
    ``unitary_synthesis_method`` kwarg to the plugin's name. A full list of
    installed plugins can be found using the
    :func:`qiskit.transpiler.passes.synthesis.plugin.unitary_synthesis_plugin_names`
    function. For example, if you installed a package that includes a synthesis
    plugin named ``special_synth`` you could use it with::

      from qiskit import transpile

      transpile(qc, unitary_synthesis_method='special_synth', optimization_level=3)

    this will replace all uses of the :class:`~qiskit.transpiler.passes.UnitarySynthesis`
    with the method included in the external package that exports the ``special_synth``
    plugin.

    The plugin interface is built around setuptools
    `entry points <https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/userguide/entry_point.html>`__
    which enables packages external to Qiskit to advertise they include a
    synthesis plugin. For details on writing a new plugin refer to the
    :mod:`qiskit.transpiler.passes.synthesis.plugin` module documentation.
upgrade:

    A new dependency `stevedore <https://pypi.org/project/stevedore/>`__ has
    been added to the requirements list. This is required by qiskit-terra as
    it's used to build the unitary synthesis plugin interface.
