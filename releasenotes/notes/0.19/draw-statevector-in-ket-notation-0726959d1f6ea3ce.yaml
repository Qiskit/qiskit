    The :obj:`.Statevector`\ s of states comprised only of qubits can now be
    drawn in LaTeX in ket notation.  In ket notation the entries of the
    statevector are processed such that exact factors like fractions or square
    roots of two are drawn as such.  The particular convention can be chosen by
    passing the ``convention`` keyword argument as either ``"ket"`` or
    ``"vector"`` as appropriate::

        import math
        from qiskit.quantum_info import Statevector

        sv = Statevector([math.sqrt(0.5), 0, 0, -math.sqrt(0.5)])
        sv.draw("latex", convention="ket")
        sv.draw("latex", convention="vector")
upgrade:
  - |
    The output of :meth:`.Statevector.draw` when using ``"latex"`` output is
    now the new ``"ket"`` convention if plotting a state comprised purely of qubits.
    This was changed to make reading the output clearer, especially in
    educational contexts, because it shows the ket labels, and only displays the
    nonzero elements.
issues:
  - |
    The ``"ket"`` convention in the ``"latex"`` drawer of :meth:`.Statevector.draw`
    is only valid for states comprising purely of qubits.  If you are using states
    with some spaces of dimension greater than two, you should either pass
    ``convention="vector"``, or use a different drawer.
