    :obj:`.Statevector` can now be drawn in LaTeX in both vector and ket notation.
    In ket notation the entries of the statevector are processed such that 
    exact factors like fractions or square roots of two are drawn as such.
    The old notation is still available as an option by setting the ``convention`` argument.

    .. code-block:: python

        import math
        from qiskit.quantum_info import Statevector

        sv = Statevector([math.sqrt(0.5), 0, 0, -math.sqrt(0.5)])
        sv.draw(output='latex')
        sv.draw(output='latex', convention='vector')  # old behaviour
