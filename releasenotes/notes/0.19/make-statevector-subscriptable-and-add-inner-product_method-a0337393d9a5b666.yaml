features:

    The :class:`~qiskit.quantum_info.Statevector` class is now subscriptable.
    User can now retrieve the nth element in a :class:`~qiskit.quantum_info.Statevector` by index as ``statevec[n]``.

    See `#4916 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/4916>`__ from more information.

    Added the :obj:`.Statevector.inner` method to calculate inner products of statevectors.  For example::

      statevec_inner_other = statevec.inner(other)

    See `#4934 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/4934>`__ from more information.
