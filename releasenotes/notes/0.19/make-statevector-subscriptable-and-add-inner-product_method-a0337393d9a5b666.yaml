features:

    The :class:`~qiskit.quantum_info.Statevector` class is now subscriptable.
    User can now retrieve the nth coefficient in a
    :class:`~qiskit.quantum_info.Statevector` by index as ``statevec[n]``.
  - |
    Added the :obj:`.Statevector.inner` method to calculate inner products of
    :class:`.Statevector` instances.  For example::

        statevec_inner_other = statevec.inner(other)

    will return the inner product of ``statevec`` with ``other``.  While
    ``statevec`` must be a :class:`.Statevector`, ``other`` can be anything
    that can be constructed into a :class:`.Statevector`, such as a Numpy array.
