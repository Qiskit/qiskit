deprecations:
  - |
    The ``label`` property of class
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.generalized_gates.mcmt.MCMT` and subclass
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.generalized_gates.mcmt.MCMTVChain` has been
    deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Consequently, the
    ``label`` kwarg on the constructor for both classes is also deprecated,
    along with the ``label`` kwarg of method
    :meth:`~qiskit.circuit.library.generalized_gates.mcmt.MCMT.control`.
    Currently, the ``label`` property is used to name the controlled target
    when it is comprised of more than one target qubit, however, this was
    never intended to be user-specifiable, and can result in an incorrect
    MCMT gate if the name of a well-known operation is used.
    After deprecation, the ``label`` property will no longer be
    user-specifiable. However, you can get the generated name of the controlled
    target via ``MCMT.data[0][0].base_gate.name``.
