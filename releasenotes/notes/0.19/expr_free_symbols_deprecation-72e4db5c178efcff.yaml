    Fixed a deprecation warning emitted when running
    :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.draw` or :func:`.circuit_drawer` with Sympy 1.9
    installed, mentioning the Sympy function ``expr_free_symbols()``.
    The circuit drawers previously made use of this method when finding
    instances of symbolic constants.
