    Fixed an issue in :obj:`.PiecewiseChebyshev` when the function to be
    approximated was constant.  In these cases, you should now pass the constant
    directly as the ``f_x`` argument, rather than using a function, such as::

        from qiskit.circuit.library.arithmetic import PiecewiseChebyshev

        PiecewiseChebyshev(1.0, degree=3)

    See `#6707 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/pull/6707>`__ for more details.
