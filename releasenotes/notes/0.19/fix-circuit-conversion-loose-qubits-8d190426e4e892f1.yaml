    Fixed an error in the circuit conversion functions
    :func:`.circuit_to_gate` and :func:`.circuit_to_instruction` (and their
    associated circuit methods :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.to_gate` and
    :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.to_instruction`) when acting on a circuit with
    registerless bits, or bits in more than one register.
