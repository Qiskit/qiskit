    Fixed an error in the circuit conversion functions
    :func:`.circuit_to_gate` and :func:`.circuit_to_instruction` (and their
    associated circuit methods :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.to_gate` and
    :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.to_instruction`) when acting on a circuit with
    registerless bits, or bits in more than one register.  Previously, the
    number of bits necessary for the created gate or instruction would be
    calculated incorrectly, often causing an exception during the conversion.
