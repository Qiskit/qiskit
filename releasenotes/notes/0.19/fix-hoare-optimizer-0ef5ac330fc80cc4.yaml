    Fixed a bug in the Hoare optimizer transpilation pass where it could attempt
    to remove a gate twice if it could be separately combined with both its
    predecessor and its successor to form the identity.  Refer to `#7271
    <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/7271>`__ for more details.
