features:
  - |
    Added method :meth:`~qiskit.dagcircuit.DAGCircuit.remove_cregs`
    to class :class:`~qiskit.dagcircuit.DAGCircuit` to support classical
    register removal.
  - |
    Added method :meth:`~qiskit.dagcircuit.DAGCircuit.remove_clbits`
    to class :class:`~qiskit.dagcircuit.DAGCircuit` to support the removal
    of idle classical bits. Any classical registers referencing a removed bit
    are also removed.

fixes:
  - |
    Fixed determination of final operations (barriers and measures) in pass
    :class:`~qiskit.transpiler.passes.RemoveFinalMeasurements` and in method
    :meth:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.remove_final_measurements`
    of class :class:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit` which previously considered
    only nodes immediately preceding an output node.
  - |
    Fixed determination of final operations in pass
    :class:`~qiskit.transpiler.passes.RemoveFinalMeasurements` and in method
    :meth:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.remove_final_measurements` of class
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit` which could wrongly consider a barrier
    to be final, even if other circuit operations followed it.
  - |
    Fixed multi-bit classical register removal in pass
    :class:`~qiskit.transpiler.passes.RemoveFinalMeasurements` and in method
    :meth:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.remove_final_measurements` of class
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit` where classical
    registers were not removed even if other bits were idle, unless a final measure
    was done into each and every bit. Now, classical registers that become idle as a
    result of removing final measurements and barriers are always removed. Classical
    bits are removed if they are referenced only by removed registers or are not
    referenced at all and became idle due to the removal. This fix also adds proper
    handling of registers with shared underlying bits.

    Fixed an issue with :obj:`~qiskit.transpiler.passes.RemoveFinalMeasurements`
    which could cause the resulting :obj:`.DAGCircuit` to become invalid.  See
    `#7196 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/pull/7196>`__ for more details.
  - |
    Fixed an issue with method :meth:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.remove_final_measurements`
    of class :class:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit` that caused :attr:`.QuantumCircuit.clbits`
    to be incorrect after invocation. Refer to
    `#7089 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/7089>`__ for details.
