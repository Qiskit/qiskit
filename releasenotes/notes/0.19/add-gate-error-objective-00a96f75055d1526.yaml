    The values ``"gate_error"`` and ``"balanced"`` are now available for the ``objective`` option in the construction of the :class:`~qiskit.transpiler.passes.BIPMapping` object.
    Those objectives require ``backend_prop``, which contains the 2q-gate gate errors used in the computation of the objectives.
