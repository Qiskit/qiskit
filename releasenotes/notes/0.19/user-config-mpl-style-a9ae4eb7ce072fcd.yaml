    Fixed an issue with the :meth:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.draw` method and
    :func:`~qiskit.visualization.circuit_drawer` function, where a custom style set via the
    user config file (i.e. ``settings.conf``) would ignore the set value of the
    ``circuit_mpl_style`` field if the ``style`` kwarg on the function/method was not
    set.
