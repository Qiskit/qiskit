deprecations:
  - |
    The :class:`~qiskit.dagcircuit.DAGNode` class is being deprecated as a
    standalone class and will be used in the future only as the parent class for
    :class:`~qiskit.dagcircuit.DAGOpNode`,
    :class:`~qiskit.dagcircuit.DAGInNode`, and
    :class:`~qiskit.dagcircuit.DAGOutNode`. As part of this deprecation, the
    following kwargs and associated attributes in :obj:`.DAGNode` are also being
    deprecated: ``type``, ``op``, and ``wire``.
upgrade:
  - |
    The previously deprecated ``condition`` kwarg, which was deprecated as part
    of the 0.15.0 release, has been removed from
    :meth:`.DAGCircuit.apply_operation_back` and
    :meth:`.DAGCircuit.apply_operation_front`. Instead set the ``condition``
    attribute on the :class:`~qiskit.circuit.Instruction` instances being added
    to the :class:`~qiskit.dagcircuit.DAGCircuit` using :meth:`.Instruction.c_if`.
