    Fixed an issue where calling :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.decompose()` on a
    circuit containing an :class:`~qiskit.circuit.Instruction` whose
    :attr:`~.Instruction.definition` attribute was empty would leave the
    instruction in place, instead of decomposing it into zero operations. For
    example, with a circuit::
    
        from qiskit.circuit import QuantumCircuit
        empty = QuantumCircuit(1, name="decompose me!")
        circuit = QuantumCircuit(1)
        circuit.append(empty.to_gate(), [0])
        
    Previously, calling ``circuit.decompose()`` would not change the circuit.
    Now, the decomposition will correct decompose ``empty`` into zero
    instructions.
