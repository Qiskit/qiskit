    Fixed a bug where many layout methods would ignore 3-or-more qubit gates, resulting in unexpected layout-allocation decisions.
    The transpiler pass :class:`.Unroll3qOrMore` is now being executed before the layout pass.
    Fixed `#7156 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/7156>`__.
