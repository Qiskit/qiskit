    Fixed a bug where many layout methods would ignore 3-or-more qubit gates,
    resulting in unexpected layout-allocation decisions.  The transpiler pass
    :class:`.Unroll3qOrMore` is now being executed before the layout pass in all
    the preset pass managers when :func:`~.compiler.transpile` is called.  Fixed `#7156
    <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/7156>`__.
