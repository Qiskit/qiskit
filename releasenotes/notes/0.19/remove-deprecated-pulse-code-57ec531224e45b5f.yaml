    Various methods of assigning parameters to operands of pulse program
    instructions have been removed, having been deprecated in Qiskit Terra 0.17.
    These include:
    
    * the ``assign()`` method of :obj:`.pulse.Instruction`.
    * the ``assign()`` method of ``Channel``, which is the base of
      :obj:`.AcquireChannel`, :obj:`.SnapshotChannel`, :obj:`.MemorySlot` and
      :obj:`.RegisterSlot`.
    * the ``assign()`` and ``assign_parameters()`` methods of
      ``ParametricPulse``, which is the base of :obj:`.pulse.Gaussian`,
      :obj:`.pulse.GaussianSquare`, :obj:`.pulse.Drag` and :obj:`.pulse.Constant`.

    These parameters should be assigned from the pulse program
    (:class:`.pulse.Schedule` and :class:`.pulse.ScheduleBlock`) rather than
    operands of the pulse program instruction.
  - |
    The ``flatten()`` method of :class:`.pulse.Instruction` and
    :class:`qiskit.pulse.Schedule` has been removed and no longer exists as per
    the deprecation notice from Qiskit Terra 0.17. This transformation is
    defined as a standalone function in
    :func:`qiskit.pulse.transforms.canonicalization.flatten`.
  - |
    ``qiskit.pulse.interfaces.ScheduleComponent`` has been removed and no longer
    exists as per the deprecation notice from Qiskit Terra 0.15. No alternative
    class will be provided.
  - |
    Legacy pulse drawer arguments have been removed from
    :meth:`.pulse.Waveform.draw`, :meth:`.Schedule.draw` and
    :meth:`.ScheduleBlock.draw` and no longer exist as per the deprecation
    notice from Qiskit Terra 0.16. Now these draw methods support only V2 pulse
    drawer arguments. See method documentations for details.
  - |
    The ``qiskit.pulse.reschedule`` module has been removed and this import path
    no longer exist as per the deprecation notice from Qiskit Terra 0.14. Use
    :mod:`qiskit.pulse.transforms` instead.
  - |
    A protected method ``Schedule._children()`` has been removed and replaced by
    a protected instance variable as per the deprecation notice from Qiskit
    Terra 0.17.  This is now provided as a public attribute
    :obj:`.Schedule.children`.
  - |
    Timeslot relevant methods and properties have been removed and no longer
    exist in :class:`~.pulse.ScheduleBlock` as per the deprecation notice from
    Qiskit Terra 0.17.  Since this representation doesn't have notion of
    instruction time ``t0``, the timeslot information will be available after it
    is transformed to a :obj:`~.pulse.Schedule`.  Corresponding attributes have
    been provided after this conversion, but they are no longer supported.  The
    following attributes are removed:

    * ``timeslots``
    * ``start_time``
    * ``stop_time``
    * ``ch_start_time``
    * ``ch_stop_time``
    * ``shift``
    * ``insert``
  - |
    Alignment pulse schedule transforms have been removed and no longer exist as
    per the deprecation notice from Qiskit Terra 0.17. These transforms are
    integrated and implemented in the ``AlignmentKind`` context of the schedule
    block.  The following explicit transform functions are removed:

    * ``qiskit.pulse.transforms.align_equispaced``
    * ``qiskit.pulse.transforms.align_func``
    * ``qiskit.pulse.transforms.align_left``
    * ``qiskit.pulse.transforms.align_right``
    * ``qiskit.pulse.transforms.align_sequential``
  - |
    Redundant pulse builder commands have been removed and no longer exist as
    per the deprecation notice from Qiskit Terra 0.17.
    ``pulse.builder.call_schedule`` and ``pulse.builder.call_circuit`` have been
    integrated into :func:`.pulse.builder.call`.
