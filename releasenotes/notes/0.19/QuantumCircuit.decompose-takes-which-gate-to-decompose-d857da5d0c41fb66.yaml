    :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.decompose` and its corresponding transpiler pass now optionally accept a parameter containing a collection of gate names.
    If this parameter is given, then only gates with matching names will be decomposed.
    This supports Unix-shell-style wildcard matches.  For example::

        qc.decompose(["cz", "h"])

    will decompose any ``cz`` or ``h`` gates, but leave (for example) ``x`` gates untouched.

    See  `#2906 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/2906>`__ for more information.

deprecations:
  - |
    The ``gate`` attribute and initialization parameter of :obj:`qiskit.transpiler.passes.basis.Decompose` is deprecated.
    Instead of this single gate, you should pass a list of gate names to the new parameter ``gates_to_decompose``.
