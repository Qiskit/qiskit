features:
  - |
    Allows specification of gates to decompose inside `circuit.decompose()` (and
    in the :class:`qiskit.transpiler.passes.basis.Decompose` pass).
    It takes input as a list of strings or gates as well as single strings or gates
    and also supports wildcards.

    For example::
      circ.decompose(['cz','h'])

    See  `#2906 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/2906>`__ for more information.

deprecations:
  - |
    There is a deprecation of the `gate` param for
    the :class:`qiskit.transpiler.passes.basis.Decompose` and is replaced by `gates_to_decompose`.
