    :obj:`~qiskit.cicuit.ParameterExpression` now delegates its numeric
    conversions to the underlying symbolic library, even if there are
    potentially unbound parameters.  This allows conversions of expressions such
    as ::

      >>> from qiskit.circuit import Parameter
      >>> x = Parameter('x')
      >>> float(x - x + 2.3)
      2.3

    where the underlying expression has a fixed value, but the parameter ``x``
    is not yet bound.
