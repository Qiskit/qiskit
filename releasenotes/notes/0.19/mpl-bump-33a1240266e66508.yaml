    The minimum supported version of matplotlib has been raised from 2.1.0 to
    3.3.0. You will now need to have matplotlib 3.3.0 installed if you're using
    matplotlib based visualization functions such as the ``'mpl'`` backend for
    the :func:`~qiskit.visualization.circuit_drawer` function or the
    :func:`~qiskit.visualization.plot_bloch_vector` function. This was done for
    two reasons, the first is because recent versions of matplotlib have
    deprecated the use of APIs around 3D visualizations that were compatible
    with older releases and second installing older versions of matplotlib
    was becoming increasingly difficult as matplotlib's upstream dependencies
    have caused incompatiblities that made testing moving forward more
    difficult.
