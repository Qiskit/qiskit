    Added an argument ``limit_amplitude`` to the constructor of
    ``ParametricPulse``, which is the base class of :obj:`.Gaussian`,
    :obj:`.GaussianSquare`, :obj:`.Drag` and :obj:`.Constant`, to allowing
    disabling the amplitude limit of 1 on a pulse-by-pulse basis.  With
    ``limit_amplitude=False``, individual pulses may have an amplitude exceeding
    unity without raising a :class:`.PulseError`.  See `#6544
    <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/6544>`__ for more
    detail.
