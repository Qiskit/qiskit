    Added an argument ``limit_amplitude`` to the constructor of ``ParametricPulse``,
    which is the base class of :obj:`.Gaussian`, :obj:`.GaussianSquare`, :obj:`.Drag` and :obj:`.Constant`, to
    enable or disable the amplitude limit of 1 on the pulse. This
    option gets propagated to the parent class ``Pulse``. With this option enabled,
    the ``ParametricPulse`` class and its subclasses do not allow amplitudes larger
    than 1. By default, the value of ``limit_amplitude`` is true, so that the
    amplitude is constrained to be less than 1. See `#6544 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/6544>`__ for more detail.
