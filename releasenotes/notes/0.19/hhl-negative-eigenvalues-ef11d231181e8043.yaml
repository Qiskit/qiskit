    The :obj:`.HHL` algorithm can now find solutions when its matrix has negative eigenvalues.
    This involved adding an extra qubit to represent the sign of the value, and updating
    the helper algorithm :obj:`.ExactReciprocal` to process this new information.
    See `#6971 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/pull/6971>`__ for more details.
