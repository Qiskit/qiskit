    Complex valued pulse parameter assignment with symengine has been fixed. For example,

    .. code-block:: python

      from qiskit import circuit, pulse
      import numpy as np

      amp = circuit.Parameter("amp")
      phase = circuit.Parameter("phase")

      with pulse.build() as sched:
          pulse.play(pulse.Gaussian(160, amp * np.exp(1j * phase), 40), pulse.DriveChannel(0))
      sched.assign_parameters({amp: 0.1, phase: 1.57}, inplace=True)

    The assigned amplitude has been shown as
    ``ParameterExpression(0.1*exp(1.57*I))`` after the use of ``symengine`` was
    introduced in the 0.18.0 release.  This is now correctly evaluated and shown
    as ``7.96327e-05 + 0.0999999683j``.
