    Improve the performance of :meth:`~qiskit.quantum_info.Clifford.dot`,
    when it is composed with a :class:`QuantumCircuit`.
    In this case, we use new internal methods to iteratively update the Clifford
    by prepending with standard Clifford gates.
    This scheme is significantly more efficient than the previous method of converting
    the gates to Clifford and composing the Clifford tableaux.
