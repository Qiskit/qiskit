    Improve the performance of :meth:`~qiskit.quantum_info.Clifford.dot`,
    when it is composed with a :class:`QuantumCircuit`.
    In this case, we iteratively update the Clifford by prepending it with standard Clifford gates.
    This scheme is significantly more efficient than the previous method of converting
    the gates to Clifford and composing the Clifford tableaux, when the number of prepended
    gates is small compared to the Clifford size.
