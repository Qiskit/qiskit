    Improve the performance of :meth:`.Clifford.dot` and of :meth:`.Clifford.compose`
    when called with `front=True`, in the case that the Clifford is composed with a
    :class:`.QuantumCircuit` consisting of Clifford operations (for instance, of standard
    Clifford gates). The new method consists of iteratively updating the Clifford by
    prepending it with Clifford operations, similarly to the current behavior of
    :meth:`.Clifford.compose` when called with `front=False`. When the number of
    operations in the circuit is small, this method is significantly more efficient than
    the old method consisting of converting the circuit into a Clifford and composing
    the two Cliffords.
