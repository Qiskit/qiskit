    The SI unit use for constructing :py:class:`qiskit.pulse.SetFrequency`
    objects is in Hz, but when a :class:`~qiskit.qobj.PulseQobjInstruction`
    object is created from a :py:class:`~qiskit.pulse.SetFrequency` instance
    it needs to be converted to GHz. This conversion was missing from previous
    releases and has been fixed.
