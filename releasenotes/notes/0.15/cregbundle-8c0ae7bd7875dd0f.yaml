upgrade:
  - |
    The default value of the ``cregbundle`` kwarg for the
    :meth:`qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.draw` method and
    :func:`qiskit.visualization.circuit_drawer` function has been changed
    to ``True``. This means that by default the classical bits in the
    circuit diagram will now be bundled by default, for example:

    .. jupyter-execute::

      from qiskit.circuit import QuantumCircuit

      circ = QuantumCircuit(4)
      circ.x(0)
      circ.h(1)
      circ.measure_all()
      circ.draw(output='mpl')

    If you want to have your circuit drawing retain the previous behavior
    and show each classical bit in the diagram you can set the ``cregbundle``
    kwarg to ``False``. For example:

    .. jupyter-execute::

      from qiskit.circuit import QuantumCircuit

      circ = QuantumCircuit(4)
      circ.x(0)
      circ.h(1)
      circ.measure_all()
      circ.draw(output='mpl', cregbundle=False)
