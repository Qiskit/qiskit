    The :meth:`~qiskit.dagcircuit.DAGCircuit.qubits` and
    :meth:`~qiskit.dagcircuit.DAGCircuit.clbits` methods of
    :class:`qiskit.dagcircuit.DAGCircuit` have been deprecated and will be
    removed in a future release. They have been replaced with properties of
    the same name, :attr:`qiskit.dagcircuit.DAGCircuit.qubits` and
    :attr:`qiskit.dagcircuit.DAGCircuit.clbits`, and are cached so
    accessing them is much faster.
