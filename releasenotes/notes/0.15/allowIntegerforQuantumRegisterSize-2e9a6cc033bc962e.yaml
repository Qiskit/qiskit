    When accessing a bit from a
    :class:`qiskit.circuit.QuantumRegister` or
    :class:`qiskit.circuit.ClassicalRegister` by index when using numpy
    `integer types` <https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/basics.types.html>`__
    would previously raise a ``CircuitError`` exception. This has been
    resolved so numpy types can be used in addition to Python's built-in
    ``int`` type.
    Fixes `#3929 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/3929>`__.
