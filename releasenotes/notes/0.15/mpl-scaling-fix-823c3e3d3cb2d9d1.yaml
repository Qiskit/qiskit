    The matplotlib (``'mpl'``) output backend for the
    :class:`qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit` method
    :meth:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.draw` and the
    :func:`qiskit.visualization.circuit_drawer` function was not properly
    scaling when the kwarg ``scale`` was set. Fonts and line widths
    did not scale with the rest of the image. This has been fixed and all
    elements of the circuit diagram now scale properly. For example:

    .. jupyter-execute::

        from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
        circuit = QuantumCircuit(2)
        circuit.h(0)
        circuit.cx(0, 1)
        circuit.draw(output='mpl', scale=0.5)

    Fixes `#4179 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/4179>`_.
