    A new kwarg ``rep_delay`` has been added to
    :func:`qiskit.compiler.assemble`, :func:`qiskit.execute.execute`, and the
    constructor for :class:`~qiskit.qobj.PulseQobjtConfig`.qiskit
    This new kwarg is used to denotes the time between program executions. It
    must be chosen from the list of valid values set as the
    ``rep_delays`` from a backend's
    :class:`~qiskit.providers.models.PulseBackendConfiguration` object which
    can be accessed as ``backend.configuration().rep_delays``).

    The ``rep_delay`` kwarg will only work on backends which allow for dynamic
    repetition time. This will also be indicated in the
    :class:`~qiskit.providers.models.PulseBackendConfiguration` object for a
    backend as the ``dynamic_reprate_enabled`` attribute. If
    ``dynamic_reprate_enabled`` is ``False`` then the ``rep_time`` value
    specified for :func:`qiskit.compiler.assemble`,
    :func:`qiskit.execute.execute`, or the constructor for
    :class:`~qiskit.qobj.PulseQobjtConfig` will be used rather than
    ``rep_delay``. ``rep_time`` only allows users to specify the duration of a
    program, rather than the delay between programs.

    The ``qobj_schema.json`` JSON Schema file in :mod:`qiskit.schemas` has
    been updated to include the ``rep_delay`` as an optional configuration
    property for pulse qobjs.

    The ``backend_configuration_schema.json`` JSON Schema file in
    :mod:`qiskit.schemas` has been updated to include ``rep_delay_range`` and
    ``default_rep_delay`` as optional properties for a pulse backend
    configuration.
