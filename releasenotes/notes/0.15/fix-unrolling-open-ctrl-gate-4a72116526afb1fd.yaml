    Open controls were implemented by modifying a :class:`~qiskit.circuit.Gate`
    objects :attr:`~qiskit.circuit.Gate.definition`. However, when the gate
    already exists in the basis set, this definition was not used, which
    resulted in incorrect circuits being sent to a backend after transpilation.
    This has been fixed by modifying the :class:`~qiskit.transpiler.Unroller`
    pass to use the definition if it encounters a controlled gate with open
    controls.
    Fixes `#4437 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/4437>`__
