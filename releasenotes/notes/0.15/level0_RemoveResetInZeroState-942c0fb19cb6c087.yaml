    The pass :class:`~qiskit.transpiler.passes.RemoveResetInZeroState` was
    previously included in the preset pass manager
    :func:`~qiskit.transpiler.preset_passmanagers.level_0_pass_manager` which
    was used with the ``optimization_level=0`` for
    :func:`~qiskit.compiler.transpile` and :func:`~qiskit.execute.execute`
    functions. However,
    :class:`~qiskit.transpiler.passes.RemoveResetInZeroState` is an
    optimization pass and should not have been included in optimization level
    0 and was removed. If you need to run :func:`~qiskit.compiler.transpile`
    with :class:`~qiskit.transpiler.passes.RemoveResetInZeroState` either use
    a custom pass manager or ``optimization_level`` 1, 2, or 3.
