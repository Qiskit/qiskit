deprecations:
  - |
    The properties ``acquires``, ``mem_slots``, and ``reg_slots`` of the
    :class:`qiskit.pulse.instructions.Acquire` pulse instruction have been
    deprecated and will be removed in a future release. They are just
    duplicates of :attr:`~qiskit.pulse.instructions.Acquire.channel`,
    :attr:`~qiskit.pulse.instructions.Acquire.mem_slot`,
    and :attr:`~qiskit.pulse.instructions.Acquire.reg_slot` respectively
    now that previously deprecated support for using multiple qubits in a
    single :class:`~qiskit.pulse.instructions.Acquire` instruction has been
    removed.

upgrade:
  - |
    The option to acquire multiple qubits at once was deprecated in the 0.12.0
    release and is now removed. Specifically, the init args ``mem_slots`` and
    ``reg_slots`` have been removed from
    :class:`qiskit.pulse.instructions.Acquire`, and ``channel``, ``mem_slot``
    and ``reg_slot`` will raise an error if a list is provided as input.
