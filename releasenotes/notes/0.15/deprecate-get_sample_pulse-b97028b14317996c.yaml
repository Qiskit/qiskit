    The ``get_sample_pulse`` method for
    ``qiskit.pulse.library.ParametricPulse`` derived classes (for example
    :class:`~qiskit.pulse.library.GaussianSquare`) has been deprecated and
    will be removed in a future release. It has been replaced by the
    ``get_waveform`` method (for example
    :meth:`~qiskit.pulse.library.GaussianSquare.get_waveform`) which should
    behave identically.
