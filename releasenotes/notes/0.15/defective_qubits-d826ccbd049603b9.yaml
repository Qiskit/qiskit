    Support was added to the :func:`qiskit.compiler.transpile` function for handling backends that have qubits or
    gates marked as defective in their :class:`~qiskit.providers.models.BackendProperties`. If a gate or qubit
    parameter in the :class:`~qiskit.providers.models.BackendProperties` has an ``operational`` field and it
    is set to ``False``, then the :func:`~qiskit.compiler.transpile` function will consider the maximum connected
    subgraph of operational qubits as a coupling map and handle the process to avoid using non-operational
    qubits/gates.
