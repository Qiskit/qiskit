    For the ``seed`` kwarg in the constructor for
    :class:`qiskit.circuit.library.QuantumVolume` `numpy random Generator
    objects <https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/generator.html>`__
    can now be used. Previously, only integers were a valid input. This is
    useful when integrating :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.QuantumVolume` as
    part of a larger function with its own random number generation, e.g.
    generating a sequence of
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.QuantumVolume` circuits.
