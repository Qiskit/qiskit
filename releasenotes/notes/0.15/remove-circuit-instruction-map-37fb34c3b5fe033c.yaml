upgrade:
  - |
    The deprecated ``circuit_instruction_map`` attribute of the
    :class:`qiskit.providers.models.PulseDefaults` class has been removed.
    This attribute has been deprecated since the 0.12.0 release and was
    replaced by the ``instruction_schedule_map`` attribute which can be used
    instead.
