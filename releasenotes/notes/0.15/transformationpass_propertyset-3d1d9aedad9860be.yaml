    In previous releases a :class:`~qiskit.transpiler.PassManager`
    did not allow ``TransformationPass`` classes to modify the
    :class:`~qiskit.transpiler.PropertySet`.  This restriction has been lifted
    so a ``TransformationPass`` class now has read and write access to both
    the :class:`~qiskit.transpiler.PropertySet` and
    :class:`~qiskit.transpiler.DAGCircuit` during
    :meth:`~qiskit.transpiler.PassManager.run`. This change was made to
    more efficiently facilitate ``TransformationPass`` classes that have an
    internal state which may be necessary for later passes in the
    :class:`~qiskit.transpiler.PassManager`. Without this change a second
    redundant ``AnalysisPass`` would have been necessary to recreate the
    internal state, which could add significant overhead.
