upgrade:
  - |
    All classes and function in the ``qiskit.tool.qi`` module were deprecated
    in the 0.12.0 release and have now been removed. Instead use the
    :mod:`qiskit.quantum_info` module and the new methods and classes that
    it has for working with quantum states and operators.
  - |
    The ``qiskit.quantum_info.basis_state`` and
    ``qiskit.quantum_info.projector`` functions are deprecated as of
    Qiskit Terra 0.12.0 as are now removed. Use the
    :class:`qiskit.quantum_info.QuantumState` and its derivatives
    :class:`qiskit.quantum_info.Statevector` and
    :class:`qiskit.quantum_info.DensityMatrix` to work with states.
