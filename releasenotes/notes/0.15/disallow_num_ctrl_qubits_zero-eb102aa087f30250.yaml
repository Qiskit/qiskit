    Previously it was possible to set the number of control qubits to zero in
    which case the the original, potentially non-controlled, operation would be
    returned. This could cause an ``AttributeError`` to be raised if the caller
    attempted to access an attribute which only
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.ControlledGate` object have. This has been fixed
    by adding a getter and setter for
    :attr:`~qiskit.circuit.ControlledGate.num_ctrl_qubits` to validate
    that a valid value is being used.
    Fixes `#4576 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/4576>`__
