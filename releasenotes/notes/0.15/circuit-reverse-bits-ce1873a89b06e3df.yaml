features:
  - |
    A new method :meth:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.reverse_bits` has been
    added to the :class:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit` class. This method
    will reverse the order of bits in a circuit (both quantum and classical
    bits). This can be used to switch a circuit from little-endian to big-endian
    and vice-versa.
deprecations:
  - |
    The :class:`qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit` method
    :meth:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.mirror` has been deprecated and will
    be removed in a future release. The method
    :meth:`qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.reverse_ops` should be used instead,
    since mirroring could be confused with swapping the output qubits of the
    circuit. The :meth:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.reverse_ops` method
    only reverses the order of gates that are applied instead of mirroring.
