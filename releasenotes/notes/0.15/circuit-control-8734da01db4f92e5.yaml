    A new method, :meth:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.control`, has been
    added to the :class:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit`. This method will
    return a controlled version of the :class:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit`
    object, with both open and closed controls. This functionality had
    previously only been accessible via the :class:`~qiskit.circuit.Gate`
    class.
