upgrade:
  - |
    The deprecated kwarg ``channels_to_plot`` for
    :meth:`qiskit.pulse.Schedule.draw`,
    :meth:`qiskit.pulse.Instruction.draw`,
    ``qiskit.visualization.pulse.matplotlib.ScheduleDrawer.draw`` and
    :func:`~qiskit.visualization.pulse_drawer` has been removed. The kwarg
    has been deprecated since the 0.11.0 release and was replaced by
    the ``channels`` kwarg, which functions identically and should be used
    instead.
