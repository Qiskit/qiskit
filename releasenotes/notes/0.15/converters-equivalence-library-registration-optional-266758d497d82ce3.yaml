feature:
  - |
    A new kwarg ``equivalence_library`` has been added to the
    :func:`qiskit.converters.circuit_to_gate` and
    :func`qiskit.converters.circuit_to_instruction` converter functions
    This new keyword argument is used to specify an
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.EquivalenceLibrary` object to register the
    converted gate with.
upgrade:
  - |
    The :func:`qiskit.converters.circuit_to_gate` and
    :func`qiskit.converters.circuit_to_instruction` converter functions
    had previously automatically included the generated gate or instruction
    in the active ``SessionEquivalenceLibrary``. These converters now accept
    an optional ``equivalence_library`` keyword argument to specify if and
    where the converted instances should be registered. The default behavior
    has changed to not register the converted instance.
