upgrade:
  - |
    The validation components using marshmallow from :mod:`qiskit.validation`
    have been removed from terra. Since they are no longer used to build
    any objects in terra.
  - |
    The marshmallow schema classes in :mod:`qiskit.results` have been removed
    since they are no longer used by the :class:`qiskit.result.Result` class.
  - The output of the :meth:`~qiskit.result.Result.to_dict` method for the
    :class:`qiskit.result.Result` class is no longer in a format for direct
    JSON serialization. Depending on the content contained in instances of
    these classes there may be types that the default JSON encoder doesn't know
    how to handle, for example complex numbers or numpy arrays. If you're JSON
    serializing the output of the ``to_dict()`` method directly you should
    ensure that your JSON encoder can handle these types.

other:
  - |
    The :class:`qiskit.result.Result` class which was previously constructed
    using the marshmallow library has been refactored to not depend on
    marshmallow anymore. This new implementation should be a seemless transition
    but some specific behavior that was previously inherited from marshmallow
    may not work. Please file issues for any incompatibilities found.
