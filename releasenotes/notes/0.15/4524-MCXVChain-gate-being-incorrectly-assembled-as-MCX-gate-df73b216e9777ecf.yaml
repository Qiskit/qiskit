    Implementations of the multi-controlled X Gate (
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.MCXGrayCode`,
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.MCXRecursive`, and
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.MCXVChain`) have had their ``name``
    properties changed to more accurately describe their
    implementation: ``mcx_gray``, ``mcx_recursive``, and
    ``mcx_vchain`` respectively. Previously, these gates shared the
    name ``mcx`` with :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.MCXGate`, which caused
    these gates to be incorrectly transpiled and simulated.
