    A new class :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.PhaseEstimation` has been
    added to :mod:`qiskit.circuit.library`. This circuit library class is
    the circuit used in the original formulation of the phase estimation
    algorithm in
    `arXiv:quant-ph/9511026 <https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/9511026.pdf>`__.
    Phase estimation is the task to to estimate the phase :math:`\phi` of an
    eigenvalue :math:`e^{2\pi i\phi}` of a unitary operator :math:`U`, provided
    with the corresponding eigenstate :math:`|psi\rangle`. That is

    .. math::

        U|\psi\rangle = e^{2\pi i\phi} |\psi\rangle

    This estimation (and thereby this circuit) is a central routine to several
    well-known algorithms, such as Shor's algorithm or Quantum Amplitude
    Estimation.
