    A new class for handling counts result data, :class:`qiskit.result.Counts`,
    has been added. This class is a subclass of ``dict`` and can be interacted
    with like any other dictionary. But, it includes helper methods and
    attributes for dealing with counts results from experiments and also
    handles post processing and formatting of binary strings at object
    initialization. A :class:`~qiskit.result.Counts`  object can be created by
    passing a dictionary  of counts with the keys being either integers,
    hexadecimal strings of the form ``'0x4a'``,  binary strings of the form
    ``'0b1101'``, a bit string formatted across register and memory slots
    (ie ``'00 10'``), or a dit string. For example::

      from qiskit.result import Counts

      counts = Counts({"0x0': 1, '0x1', 3, '0x2': 1020})
