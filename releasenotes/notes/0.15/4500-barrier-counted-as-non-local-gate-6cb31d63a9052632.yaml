fixes:
  - |
    The :class:`qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit` method
    :attr:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.num_nonlocal_gates` previously
    included multi-qubit :class:`qiskit.circuit.Instruction` objects
    (for example, :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.Barrier`) in its count of
    non-local gates. This has been corrected so that only non-local
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.Gate` objects are counted.
    Fixes `#4500 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/4500>`__
