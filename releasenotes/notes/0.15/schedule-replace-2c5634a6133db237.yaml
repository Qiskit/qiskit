    Added the method :meth:`~qiskit.pulse.Schedule.replace` to the
    :class:`qiskit.pulse.Schedule` class which allows a
    pulse instruction to be replaced with another. For example::

    .. code-block:: python

      from qiskit import pulse

      d0 = pulse.DriveChannel(0)

      sched = pulse.Schedule()

      old = pulse.Play(pulse.Constant(100, 1.0), d0)
      new = pulse.Play(pulse.Constant(100, 0.1), d0)

      sched += old

      sched = sched.replace(old, new)

      assert sched == pulse.Schedule(new)
