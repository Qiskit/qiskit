    A new attribute, :attr:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.global_phase`,
    which is is used for tracking the global phase has been added to the
    :class:`qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit` class. For example::

      import math

      from qiskit import QuantumCircuit

      circ = QuantumCircuit(1, global_phase=math.pi)
      circ.u1(0)

    The global phase may also be changed or queried with
    ``circ.global_phase`` in the above example. In either case the setting is
    in radians. If the circuit is converted to an instruction or gate the
    global phase is represented by two single qubit rotations on the first
    qubit.

    This allows for other methods and functions which consume a
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit` object to take global phase into
    account. For example. with the
    :attr:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.global_phase`
    attribute the :meth:`~qiskit.circuit.Gate.to_matrix` method for a gate
    can now exactly correspond to its decompositions instead of
    just up to a global phase.

    The same attribute has also been added to the
    :class:`~qiskit.dagcircuit.DAGCircuit` class so that global phase
    can be tracked when converting between
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit` and
    :class:`~qiskit.dagcircuit.DAGCircuit`.
