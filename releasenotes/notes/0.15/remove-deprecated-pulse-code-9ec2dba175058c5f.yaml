upgrade:
  - |
    The ``union`` method of :py:class:`~qiskit.pulse.Schedule` and
    :py:class:`~qiskit.pulse.Instruction` have been deprecated since
    the 0.12.0 release and have now been removed. Use
    :meth:`qiskit.pulse.Schedule.insert` and
    :meth:`qiskit.pulse.Instruction.meth` methods instead with the
    kwarg``time=0``.
  - |
    The deprecated ``scaling`` argument to the ``draw`` method of
    :py:class:`~qiskit.pulse.Schedule` and :py:class:`~qiskit.pulse.Instruction`
    has been replaced with ``scale`` since the 0.12.0 release and now has been
    removed. Use the ``scale`` kwarg instead.
  - |
    The deprecated ``period`` argument to :py:mod:`qiskit.pulse.library` functions
    have been replaced by ``freq`` since the 0.13.0 release and now removed. Use the
    ``freq`` kwarg instead of ``period``.
