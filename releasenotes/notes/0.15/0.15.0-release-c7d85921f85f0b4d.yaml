    The 0.15.0 release includes several new features and bug fixes. Some
    highlights for this release are:

    This release includes the introduction of arbitrary
    basis translation to the transpiler. This includes support for directly
    targeting a broader range of device basis sets, e.g. backends
    implementing RZ, RY, RZ, CZ or iSwap gates.

    The :class:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit` class now tracks global
    phase. This means controlling a circuit which has global phase now
    correctly adds a relative phase, and gate matrix definitions are now
    exact rather than equal up to a global phase.
