    A new Phase instruction, :class:`~qiskit.pulse.SetPhase`, has been added
    to :mod:`qiskit.pulse`. This instruction sets the phase of the
    subsequent pulses to the specified phase (in radians. For example::

      import numpy as np

      from qiskit.pulse import DriveChannel
      from qiskit.pulse import Schedule
      from qiskit.pulse import SetPhase

      sched = Schedule()
      sched += SetPhase(np.pi, DriveChannel(0))

    In this example, the phase of the pulses applied to ``DriveChannel(0)``
    after the :class:`~qiskit.pulse.SetPhase` instruction will be set to
    :math:`\pi` radians.
