    Support for the use of the ``USE_RETWORKX`` environment variable which was
    introduced in the 0.13.0 release to provide an optional fallback to the
    legacy networkx based :class:`qiskit.dagcircuit.DAGCircuit` implementation
    has been removed. This flag was only intended as provide a relief valve for
    any users that encountered a problem with the new implementation for one
    release during the transition.
