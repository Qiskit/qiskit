    Parametric pulses from :mod:`qiskit.pulse.library.discrete`
    now have zero ends of parametric pulses by default. The endpoints are
    defined such that for a function :math:`f(x)` then
    :math:`f(-1) = f(duration + 1) = 0`.
    Fixes `#4317 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/4317>`__
