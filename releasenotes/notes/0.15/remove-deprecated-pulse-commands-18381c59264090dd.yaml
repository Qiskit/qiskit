upgrade:
  - |
    The ``qiskit.pulse.commands`` module containing ``Commands`` classes
    was deprecated in the 0.13.0 release and has now been removed. You will
    have to upgrade your Pulse code if you were still using commands. For
    example:

    .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 2

      * - Old
        - New
      * - ``Command(args)(channel)``
        - ``Instruction(args, channel)``
      * - .. code-block:: python

            Acquire(duration)(AcquireChannel(0))
        - .. code-block:: python

            Acquire(duration, AcquireChannel(0))
      * - .. code-block:: python

            Delay(duration)(channel)
        - .. code-block:: python

            Delay(duration, channel)
      * - .. code-block:: python

            FrameChange(angle)(DriveChannel(0))
        - .. code-block:: python

            # FrameChange was also renamed
            ShiftPhase(angle, DriveChannel(0))
      * - .. code-block:: python

            Gaussian(...)(DriveChannel(0))
        - .. code-block:: python

            # Pulses need to be `Play`d
            Play(Gaussian(...), DriveChannel(0))
