upgrade:
  - |
    The deprecated kwarg ``line_length`` for the
    :func:`qiskit.visualization.circuit_drawer` function and
    :meth:`qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.draw` method has been removed. It
    had been deprecated since the 0.10.0 release. Instead you can use the
    ``fold`` kwarg to adjust the width of the circuit diagram.
