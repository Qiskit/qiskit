    A new kwarg for ``init_qubits`` has been added to
    :func:`~qiskit.compiler.assemble` and :func:`~qiskit.execute.execute`.
    For backends that support this feature ``init_qubits`` can be used to
    control whether the backend executing the circuits inserts any
    initialization sequences at the start of each shot. By default this is set
    to ``True`` meaning that all qubits can assumed to be in the ground state
    at the start of each shot. However, when ``init_qubits`` is  set to
    ``False`` qubits will be uninitialized at the start of each
    experiment and between shots. Note, that the backend running the circuits
    has to support this feature for this flag to have any effect.
