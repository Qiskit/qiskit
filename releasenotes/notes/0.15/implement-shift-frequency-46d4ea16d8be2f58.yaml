    A new pulse instruction :class:`~qiskit.pulse.ShiftFrequency` has been
    added to :mod:`qiskit.pulse.instructions`. This instruction enables
    shifting the frequency of a channel from its set frequency. For example::

      from qiskit.pulse import DriveChannel
      from qiskit.pulse import Schedule
      from qiskit.pulse import ShiftFrequency

      sched = Schedule()
      sched += ShiftFrequency(-340e6, DriveChannel(0))

    In this example all the pulses applied to ``DriveChannel(0)`` after the
    :class:`~qiskit.pulse.ShiftFrequency` command will have the envelope a
    frequency decremented by 340MHz.
