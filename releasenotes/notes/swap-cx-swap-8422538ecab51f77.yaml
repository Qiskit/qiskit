features:
  - |
    Adds a new gate :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.BridgeGate` which allows
    executing a CNOT between two qubits that are connected by a path of length
    greater than 1 in a quantum device.
  - |
    Adds a new transpiler pass :class:`~qiskit.transpiler.passes.SwapCXSwapToBridge`
    which runs post-routing to find instances where a routing pass inserted a SWAP-CX-SWAP
    and replaces it with a :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.BridgeGate`.
