    The :meth:`.Operator.__matmul__` method now correctly handles
    :class:`.Statevector` inputs by delegating to
    :meth:`.Statevector.evolve`, ensuring consistent behavior with
    operatorâ€“statevector application, and returning a :class:`.Statevector` of the
    appropriate dimension and mathematical matrix multiplication value.
