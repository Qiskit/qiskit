    Fixed a bug in :func:`.random_circuit` with 64 or more qubits and ``conditional=True``, where
    the resulting circuit could have an incorrectly typed value in its condition, causing a variety
    of failures during transpilation or other circuit operations.  Fixed `#9649
    <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/9649>`__.
