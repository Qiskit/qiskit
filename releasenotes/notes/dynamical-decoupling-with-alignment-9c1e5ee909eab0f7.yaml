upgrade:
  - |
    :class:`DynamicalDecoupling` has been upgraded to take ``pulse_alignment``
    which represents a hardware constraint for waveform start timing.
    The spacing between gates comprising a dynamical decoupling sequence
    is now adjusted to satisfy this constraint so that the circuit can be
    executed on hardware with the constraint.
    This value is usually found in ``backend.configuration().timing_constraints``.
  - |
    Spacing strategy of :class:`DynamicalDecoupling` has been upgraded to
    evenly split the extra slack, i.e. residual delay coming from rounding or alignment,
    to the beginning and end of the dynamical decoupling sequence,
    rather than adding it to the interval in the middle of the sequence.
  - |
    :class:`DynamicalDecoupling` has been upgraded to be a subclass of
    :class:`BasePadding`. This means the dynamical decoupling pass is
    now a drop-in replacement for the :class:`PadDelay` pass.
