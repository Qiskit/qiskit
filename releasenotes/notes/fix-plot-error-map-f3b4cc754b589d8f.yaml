    Fixed an issue with the :class:`~.plot_error_map` visualization function
    which prevented it from working when run with a backend that had readout
    error defined in the provided backend's :class:`~.BackendProperties` or
    when running with a :class:`~.BackendV2` backend.
    Fixed `#7879 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/7879>`__
