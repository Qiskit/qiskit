features:
  - |
    The Parameter class is now allowed in template optimization. It has been
    removed from the _remove_impossible() method for scenarios that are
    incompatible with template optimization. Inversion of gates is currently
    only implemented for the RXGate().
issues:
  - |
    Currently Parameters with names written as LaTeX (i.e., contain dollar
    signs '$') are incompatible with the parse_expr() method used by Sympy. 
    Currently the only gate that can be inverted (as done in the template 
    optimization algorithm) with a Parameter is the RXGate().
