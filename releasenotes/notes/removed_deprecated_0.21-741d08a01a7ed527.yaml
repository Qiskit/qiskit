    The transpilation pass ``qiskit.transpiler.passes.ALAPSchedule`` is now deprecated. It was pending for deprecation 
    since Qiskit 0.37 (with Terra 0.21), released on June 2022. The pass is replaced by 
    :class:`~.transpiler.passes.ALAPScheduleAnalysis`, which is an
    analysis pass.

    The transpilation pass ``qiskit.transpiler.passes.ASAPSchedule`` is now deprecated. It was pending for deprecation 
    since Qiskit 0.37 (with Terra 0.21), released on June 2022. It has been superseded by
    :class:`~.ASAPScheduleAnalysis` and the new scheduling workflow.

    The transpilation pass ``qiskit.transpiler.passes.DynamicalDecoupling`` is now deprecated. It was pending for deprecation 
    since Qiskit 0.37 (with Terra 0.21), released on June 2022.
    Instead, use :class:`~.transpiler.passes.PadDynamicalDecoupling`, which performs the same
    function but requires scheduling and alignment analysis passes to run prior to it.

    The transpilation pass ``qiskit.transpiler.passes.AlignMeasures`` is now deprecated. It was pending for deprecation 
    since Qiskit 0.37 (with Terra 0.21), released on June 2022.
    Instead, use :class:`~.ConstrainedReschedule`, which performs the same function 
    and also supports aligning to additional timing constraints.
