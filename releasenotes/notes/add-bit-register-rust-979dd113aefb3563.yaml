    :class:`.Bit` and :class:`.Register` as well as their subclassess are no
    longer guaranteed to be comparable using ``is`` checks, due to conversions to
    and from Python which may re-allocate each instance exposed to Python.
  - |
    :class:`.Bit` and :class:`.Register` (and their subclasses) can no longer be
    subclassed.  This was never intended to be supported behavior, and doing so
    would cause unspecified behavior in Qiskit.  It is no longer possible to do
    this as an implementation detail of the classes.
  - |
    It is no longer possible to create instances of the base :class:`.Bit` and
    :class:`.Register` classes is no longer possible. Directly instantiating
    these classes was clearly documented as something that was **not** supported
    and being able to do it was was just an implementation artifact of how the
    class heirarchy in previous releases. Starting in this release it is no longer
    possible to do this.
