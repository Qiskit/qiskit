   Python classes :class:`.Bit` and :class:`.Register` have been ported to Rust
   along with all their respective subclasses including:
   
   * :class:`.Qubit` and :class:`.QuantumRegister`.
   * :class:`.Clbit` and :class:`.ClassicalRegister`.
   * :class:`.AncillaQubit` and :class:`.AncillaRegister`.
upgrade_circuits:
  - |
    :class:`.DAGCircuit` and :class:`.CircuitData` will now store :class:`.Qubit`,
    :class:`.Clbit`, as well as its register counterparts, in Rust space.
  - The :attr:`.QuantumCircuit._qubit_indices` and :attr:`.QuantumCircuit._clbit_indices`
    attributes of the :class:`.QuantumCircuit` class have been moved to live in 
    rust space and store rust native data.
  - The :meth:`.QuantumCircuit._qbit_argument_conversion` and :meth:`.QuantumCircuit._cbit_argument_conversion`
    have been moved to Rust to operate with native data.
other:
  - |
    :class:`.Bit` and :class:`.Register` as well as their subclassess are no
    longer guaranteed to be compared using `is()` checks due to conversions to
    and from Python which would re-allocate each instance exposed to Python.
