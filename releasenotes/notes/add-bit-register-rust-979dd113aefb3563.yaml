    :class:`.Bit` and :class:`.Register` as well as their subclassess are no
    longer guaranteed to be comparable using ``is`` checks, due to conversions to
    and from Python which may re-allocate each instance exposed to Python.
  - |
    :class:`.Bit` and :class:`.Register` (and their subclasses) can no longer be
    subclassed.  This was never intended to be supported behavior, and doing so
    would cause unspecified behavior in Qiskit.  It is no longer possible to do
    this as an implementation detail of the classes.
