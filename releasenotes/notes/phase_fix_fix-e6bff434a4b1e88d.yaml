    Due to the definition of the measurements in the Opflow to be given as `~StateFn`, the phase
    fix applied in the QFI :class:`~qiskit.opflow.gradients.circuit_qfis.LinCombFull` was not
    evaluated for the correct observable. This was fixed by defining the observable via
    `StateFn(..., is_measurement=True)`.
