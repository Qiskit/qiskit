    Added utility functions - ``measure`` and ``measure_all`` in scheduler module to return a
    ``Schedule`` which measures qubits using OpenPulse. For example::

        from qiskit.scheduler import measure, measure_all

        measure_q0_schedule = measure(qubits=[0], backend=backend)
        measure_all_schedule = measure_all(backend)
        measure_custom_schedule = measure(qubits=[0],
                                          inst_map=backend.defaults().instruction_schedule_map,
                                          meas_map=[[0]],
                                          qubit_mem_slots={0: 1})
