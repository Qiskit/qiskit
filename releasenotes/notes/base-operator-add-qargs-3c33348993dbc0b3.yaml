    Adds ``qarg`` kwarg to the ``_add`` method of ``BaseOperator`` to allow
    adding a smaller operator to a larger one assuming identities on the other
    subsystems (same as for qargs on ``compose`` and ``dot`` method. This allows
    subsystem addition using the call method as with composition. This support is
    added to all BaseOperator subclasses (ScalarOp, Operator, QuantumChannel
    subclasses).

    Example
    
    .. code-block:

      from qiskit.quantum_info import Operator, ScalarOp

      ZZ = Operator.from_label('ZZ')

      # Initialize empty Hamiltonian
      n_qubits = 10
      ham = ScalarOp(2 ** n_qubits, coeff=0)

      # Add 2-body nearest neighbour terms
      for j in range(n_qubits - 1):
          ham = ham + ZZ([j, j+1])
