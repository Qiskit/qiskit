    Fixed an issue in `plot_histogram` where an error would raise because of distributions
    with unequal lengths.  This was caused by the change in PR #6340.  We remove the
    inequality altogether from the label selection, and add a test to catch the ValueError
    from MPL when the list of labels does not match the number of items to plot.
