prelude: >
    The ``inverse()`` of the ``UCGate`` class is defined by simply inverting the
    existing decomposition, but the inverse of the global phase was missing.
fixes:
  - |
    Performs the inverse of the global phase in the ``inverse()`` function.
  - |
    Fixes the global phase problem of the isometry decomposition. Refer to
    `#4687 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/4687>` for more
    details.
