    The :class:`.CommutationChecker` now supports efficient commutation checks in-between the
    Pauli-based gates :class:`.PauliGate`, :class:`.PauliEvolutionGate` and
    :class:`.PauliProductMeasurement` by checking if the generating Pauli operators commute.
    This enables optimizations in particular for circuits in Pauli-based computation format,
    expressed in terms of Pauli evolutions and Pauli product measurements.
    Note that commutations between these Pauli-based gates and other standard gates are not yet
    handled in the same efficient manner.
