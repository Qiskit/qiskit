    The :class:`.CommutationChecker` now supports efficient commutation checks in-between the
    Pauli-based gates :class:`.PauliGate`, :class:`.PauliEvolutionGate` and
    :class:`.PauliProductMeasurement` by checking if the generating Pauli operators commute.
    This enables optimizations in particular for circuits in Pauli-based computation format,
    expressed in terms of Pauli evolutions and Pauli product measurements.
    Note that commutations between these Pauli-based gates and other standard gates are not yet
    handled in the same efficient manner.

    Added a new argument, ``matrix_max_num_qubits``, to :meth:`.CommutationChecker.commute`.
    This allows to limit the size of instructions for which the commutation checker is allowed
    to compute the exponentially expensive matrix representation. This new argument allows
    to distinguish between the size limit on instructions to handle (set via ``max_num_qubits``
    which is newly ``None`` per default, meaning no limit) and a matrix size limit.
