    The Quantum Shannon Decomposition (:func:`.qs_decomposition`) includes an optimization that reduces
    the :class:`.CXGate` count in the case that the input unitary happens to be a controlled unitary.

    The `control` method of :class:`.UnitaryGate` now uses :func:`.qs_decomposition` instead of :class:`.Isometry` for decomposition.
    This change reduces the number of :class:`.CXGate` by approximately 2x.
