    Previously the `control` method of UnitaryGate was utilizing `Isometry` for decomposition.
    This improvement switches the synthesis to `qs_decomposition` which approximately halves the gate count.

    An improvement to the Quantum Shannon Decomposition `qs_decomposition` was added which reduces the CNOT gate count
    in the special case that the input unitary appears to be a controlled unitary.
