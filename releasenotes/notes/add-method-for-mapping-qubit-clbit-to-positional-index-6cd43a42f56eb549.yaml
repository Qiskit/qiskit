  A new :meth:`~qiskit.dagcircuit.dag.find_bit` method has
  been added to the :class:`~qiskit.dagcircuit.DagCircuit` class,
  which is a method to get mapping of Qubit and Clbit to positional index. 
  The method takes a Bit as input, checks whether it's a Qubit or a Clbit, 
  and then returns the corresponding BitPosition from the respective index 
  dictionary (_qubit_indices or _clbit_indices).
  The BitPosition is a namedtuple which includes the positional index of the 
  bit in the circuit and a list of registers containing the bit. If the bit 
  cannot be found or is of an unknown type, it raises a DAGCircuitError.

  Transpiler passes have been replaced to use this new method. 
  Updated add_qubit, add_clbit, add_qreg, add_creg, remove_qubit, 
  remove_clbit, remove_qreg, remove_creg methods to update qubit 
  and clbit indices and registers
