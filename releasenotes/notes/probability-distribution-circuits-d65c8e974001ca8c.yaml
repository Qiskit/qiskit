    Add several classes to load probability distributions into qubit amplitudes;
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.UniformDistribution`,
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.NormalDistribution`, and
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.LogNormalDistribution`.
    The normal and log-normal distribution support both univariate and multivariate
    distributions. These circuits are central to applications in finance where 
    quantum amplitude estimation is used.
