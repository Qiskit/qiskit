    Added new half adder that requires no ancillary qubits and has better CX count compared to
    :func:`.adder_qft_d00`:

    * :func:`.adder_ripple_rv_25`

features_transpiler:
  - |
    Added new high-level-synthesis plugin for synthesizing a :class:`.HalfAdder`:

    * :class:`.HalfAdderSynthesisRV25`, based on :func:`.adder_ripple_rv_25`.

    The :class:`.HalfAdderSynthesisDefault` has also been updated to follow the following sequence
    of half adder synthesizers: ``"HalfAdder.ripple_rv25"`` when the number of qubits is 
    :math:`\leq 3`, ``"HalfAdder.ripple_c04"`` when 1 ancillary qubit is available, 
    ``"HalfAdder.ripple_rv25"`` in all remaining cases.
