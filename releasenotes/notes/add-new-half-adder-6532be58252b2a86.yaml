features_synthesis:
  - |
    Added new half adder that requires no ancillary qubits and has better CX count compared to
    :func:`.adder_qft_d00`:

    * :func:`.adder_ripple_rv_25`

features_transpiler:
  - |
    Added new high-level-synthesis plugin for synthesizing a :class:`.HalfAdder`:

    * :class:`.HalfAdderSynthesisRV25`, based on :func:`.adder_ripple_rv_25`.

    The :class:`.HalfAdderSynthesisDefault` has also been updated to follow the following sequence
    of HalfAdder synthesizers: "HalfAdder.ripple_rv25" when n_qubits <= 3, "HalfAdder.ripple_c04"
    when 1 ancillary qubit is available, "HalfAdder.ripple_rv25" in all remaining cases.

  - |
    Added new :class:`.Adder` based on :func:`.adder_ripple_rv_25` called :class:`.RVRippleCarryAdder`.
