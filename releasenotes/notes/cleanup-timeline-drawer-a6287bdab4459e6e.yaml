features:
  - |
    New attribute :attr:`op_start_times` has been added to :class:`~QuantumCircuit`.
    This information is populated when one of scheduling analysis passes is run on the circuit.
    It can be used to obtain circuit instruction with instruction time, for example:

    .. code-block:: python

      from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, transpile
      from qiskit.test.mock import FakeMontreal

      backend = FakeMontreal()

      qc = QuantumCircuit(2)
      qc.h(0)
      qc.cx(0, 1)

      qct = transpile(
          qc, backend, initial_layout=[0, 1], coupling_map=[[0, 1]], scheduling_method="alap"
      )
      scheduled_insts = list(zip(qct.op_start_times, qct.data))

fixes:
  - |
    Time misalignment bug of drawing classical register with :func:`~timeline_drawer`
    has been fixed. Now classical register slots are drawn at correct position.
deprecations:
  - |
    Calling :func:`~timeline_drawer` with unscheduled circuit has been deprecated.
    All circuits, e.g. even though one consisting only of delay instructions,
    must be transpiled with ``scheduling_method`` option to generate
    schedule information being stored in :attr:`QuantumCircuit.op_start_times`.
