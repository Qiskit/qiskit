upgrade:
  - |
    A protected attribute :attr:`_node_start_time` is silently added to
    :class:`~QuantumCircuit` when one of scheduling analysis passes is run on the circuit.
    This information can be used to obtain circuit instruction with instruction time.

    .. code-block:: python

      from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, transpile
      from qiskit.test.mock import FakeMontreal

      backend = FakeMontreal()

      qc = QuantumCircuit(2)
      qc.h(0)
      qc.cx(0, 1)

      qct = transpile(
          qc, backend, initial_layout=[0, 1], coupling_map=[[0, 1]], scheduling_method="alap"
      )
      scheduled_insts = list(zip(qct._node_start_time, qct.data))

fixes:
  - |
    Time misalignment bug of drawing classical register with :func:`~timeline_drawer`
    has been fixed. Now classical register slots are drawn at correct position.
