    There has been a significant simplification to the style in which Pulse
    instructions are built.

    With the previous style, ``Command`` s were called with channels to make
    an :py:class:`~qiskit.pulse.instruction.Instruction`. The usage of both
    commands and instructions was a point of confusion. This was the previous
    style::

        sched += Delay(5)(DriveChannel(0))
        sched += ShiftPhase(np.pi)(DriveChannel(0))

    or, equivalently (though less used)::

        sched += DelayInstruction(Delay(5), DriveChannel(0))
        sched += ShiftPhaseInstruction(ShiftPhase(np.pi), DriveChannel(0))

    Now, rather than build a command *and* an instruction, each command has
    been migrated into an instruction::

        sched += Delay(5, DriveChannel(0))
        sched += ShiftPhase(np.pi, DriveChannel(0))
deprecations:
  - |
    ``DelayInstruction`` has been deprecated and replaced by
    :py:class:`~qiskit.pulse.instruction.Delay`. This new instruction has been
    taken over the previous ``Command`` ``Delay``. The migration pattern is::

        Delay(<duration>)(<channel>) -> Delay(<duration>, <channel>)
        DelayInstruction(Delay(<duration>), <channel>)
            -> Delay(<duration>, <channel>)

    Until the deprecation period is over, the previous ``Delay`` syntax of
    calling a command on a channel will also be supported::

        Delay(<phase>)(<channel>)

    The new ``Delay`` instruction does not support a ``command`` attribute.
  - |
    FrameChange and FrameChangeInstruction have been deprecated and replaced
    by ShiftPhase. The changes are::

        FrameChange(<phase>)(<channel>) -> ShiftPhase(<phase>, <channel>)
        FrameChangeInstruction(FrameChange(<phase>), <channel>)
            -> ShiftPhase(<phase>, <channel>)

    Until the deprecation period is over, the previous FrameChange syntax of
    calling a command on a channel will be supported::

        ShiftPhase(<phase>)(<channel>)
