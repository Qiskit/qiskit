    There has been a significant simplification to the style in which Pulse
    instructions are built.

    With the previous style, ``Command`` s were called with channels to make
    an :py:class:`~qiskit.pulse.instruction.Instruction`. The usage of both
    commands and instructions was a point of confusion. This was the previous
    style::

        sched += Delay(5)(DriveChannel(0))
        sched += ShiftPhase(np.pi)(DriveChannel(0))

    or, equivalently (though less used)::

        sched += DelayInstruction(Delay(5), DriveChannel(0))
        sched += ShiftPhaseInstruction(ShiftPhase(np.pi), DriveChannel(0))

    Now, rather than build a command *and* an instruction, each command has
    been migrated into an instruction::

        sched += Delay(5, DriveChannel(0))
        sched += ShiftPhase(np.pi, DriveChannel(0))
