    Previously one could define an invalid :class:`.PauliEvolutionGate`
    from a list of operators, where the operators were not all defined on
    the same number of qubits. This is now fixed, and we now raise an error
    when the gate is defined::

      from qiskit.quantum_info import Pauli, SparsePauliOp
      from qiskit.circuit.library import PauliEvolutionGate

      pauli = Pauli("XYZ")  # 3 qubits
      op = SparsePauliOp(["XYIZ"], [1])  # 4 qubits
      evo = PauliEvolutionGate([pauli, op], time=1)
