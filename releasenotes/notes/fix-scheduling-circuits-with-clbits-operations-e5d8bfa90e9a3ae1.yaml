    Fixed an issue in scheduling of circuits with clbits operations, e.g. measurements,
    conditional gates, updating
    :class:`~qiskit.transpiler.passes.ASAPSchedule`,
    :class:`~qiskit.transpiler.passes.ALAPSchedule`, and
    :class:`~qiskit.transpiler.passes.AlignMeasures`.
    The updated schedulers assume all clbits I/O operations take no time,
    ``measure`` writes the measured value to a clbit at the end, and
    ``c_if`` reads the conditional value in clbit(s) at the beginning.
    Fixed `#7006 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/7006>`__
