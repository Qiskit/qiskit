    Two new functions are added to Qiskit circuit C-Extensions:

    - qk_circuit_compose
    is similar function to ``QuantumCircuit.compose`` that merge two circuits in one circuit.
    C function version only supports `front` and `inplace` options, but both option can not
    be set to true at the same time.

    - qk_circuit_copy
    copies a circuit and returns new pointer to the copied circuit
