    A compose function is added to Qiskit circuit C-Extensions:
    ``qk_circuit_compose`` is similar function to ``QuantumCircuit.compose`` that merge two circuits in one circuit.
    C function version only supports `front` and `inplace` options, but both option can not
    be set to true at the same time.
