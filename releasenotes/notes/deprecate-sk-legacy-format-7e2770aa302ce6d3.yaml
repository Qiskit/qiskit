    Deprecated the legacy serialization format used in :class:`.SolovayKitaevDecomposition`,
    which was based on pickling the basic approximations in form of a Python dictionary.
    This loading process is a potential vulnerability and should only be used with trusted files
    and the new format does not have this problem.
    The functions to generate the legacy format, :func:`.generate_basic_approximations`, and load it,
    :meth:`.SolovayKitaevDecomposition.load_basic_approximations` and in the initializer
    of :class:`.SolovayKitaevDecomposition`, have been deprecated.
    Instead, use :meth:`.SolovayKitaevDecomposition.save_basic_approximations` to generate a format
    that can safely be loaded in the class initializer.
