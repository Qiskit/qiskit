    Fixed an issue with the :func:`~qiskit.compiler.assemble` function when
    called with the ``backend`` kwarg set and the ``parametric_pulses`` kwarg
    was set to an empty list the output qobj would contain the
    ``parametric_pulses`` setting from the given backend's
    :class:`~qiskit.providers.models.BackendConfiguration` instead of the
    expected empty list.
    Fixed `#6898 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/6898>`__
