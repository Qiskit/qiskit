    Fixed a bug that results in an error when a user tries to load .calibration
    data of a gate in :class:`.Target` in a particular situation.
    This occurs when the backend doesn't support pulse waveform payload, while
    Qiskit doesn't have corresponding parametric pulse definition.
    In this situation, Qiskit pulse object cannot be built, resulting in the failure in
    parsing PulseQobj and the user encounters a meaningless error.
    This error was suppressed, and the .calibration now returns None value instead,
    which implies the calibration data is not properly supplied.
