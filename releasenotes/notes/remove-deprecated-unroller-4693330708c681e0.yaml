    Removes the deprecated ``Unroller`` class in :mod:`qiskit.transpiler.passes.basis`.
    This class was deprecated in Qiskit Terra 0.45 and has been replaced by 
    :class:`.BasisTranslator`.

    Note that :class:`.BasisTranslator` takes different arguments than ``Unroller``, as it 
    requires a `EquivalenceLibrary` object to be passed in. 

    Example Usage:
    Instead of using ``Unroller`` as follows:
      Unroller(["u2"])
    first create a EquivalenceLibrary like:
      from qiskit.circuit.library.standard_gates.equivalence_library import (
          StandardEquivalenceLibrary as std_eqlib,
      )
    and use ``BasisTranslator`` as follows:
      BasisTranslator(std_eqlib, ["u2"])
