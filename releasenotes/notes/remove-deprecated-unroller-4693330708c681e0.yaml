    Removes the deprecated Unroller class in 'qiskit.transpiler.passes.basis'.
    This class was deprecated in Qiskit Terra 0.45 and has been replaced by
    `BasisTranslator`.

    Note that `BasisTranslator` takes different arguments than Unroller, as it 
    requires a `EquivalenceLibrary` object to be passed in.
