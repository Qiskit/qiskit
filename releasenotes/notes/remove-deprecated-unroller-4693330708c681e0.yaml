    Removes the deprecated ``Unroller`` class in :mod:`qiskit.transpiler.passes.basis`.
    This class was deprecated in Qiskit Terra 0.45 and has been replaced by 
    the combination usage of :class:`.BasisTranslator` and :class:`.UnrollCustomDefinitions`.

    Note that :class:`.BasisTranslator` and :class:`.UnrollCustomDefinitions` take different 
    arguments than ``Unroller``, as they requires a `EquivalenceLibrary` object to be passed in. 

    Example Usage:
    Instead of using ``Unroller`` as follows:
      pm = PassManager([
          Unroller(basis_gates)
      ])
    
    First create a EquivalenceLibrary like:
      from qiskit.circuit.library.standard_gates.equivalence_library import (
          StandardEquivalenceLibrary as std_eqlib,
      )
    and then use ``BasisTranslator`` and ``UnrollCustomDefinitions`` as follows:
      pm = PassManager([
          UnrollCustomDefinitions(std_eqlib, basis_gates)
          BasisTranslator(std_eqlib, basis_gates),
      ])
