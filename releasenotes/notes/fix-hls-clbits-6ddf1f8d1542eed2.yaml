    Fixed a bug in the :class:`.HighLevelSynthesis` pass where, if the circuit contained high level objects
    with classical registers, these would get mapped to the relative index in the object instead of the
    corresponding index in the outer circuit. The classical registers are now correctly mapped to the outer 
    circuit index.
