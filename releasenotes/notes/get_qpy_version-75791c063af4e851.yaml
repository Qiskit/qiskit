    Added a new function `get_qpy_version()` to the `qpy` module. This function retrieves the version of the QPy package currently in use. 
    The version is returned as an integer, which can be used for logging or debugging purposes.
    see `#14201 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/14201>`__.
