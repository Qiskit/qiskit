    Adds a new 2-qubit gate, the echo cross-resonance (ECR), which is two
    CR(Ï€/4) pulses with an X gate between them for the echo. This gate is
    locally equivalent to a CNOT (can convert to a CNOT with local
    pre- or post-rotation). It is the native gate on current IBM hardware
    and compiling to it allows the pre-/post-rotations to be merged into
    the rest of the circuit.

    A new option `approximation_degree` is added to the transpiler for
    approximate compilation. Valid values range from 0 to 1, and higher
    means less approximation. This is a heuristic dial
    to experiment with circuit approximations. The concrete interpretation
    of this number is left to each pass, which may use it to perform
    some approximate version of the pass. Specific examples include
    unitary synthesis or translators to discrete gate sets.
    If a pass does not support this option, it implies exact transformation.
