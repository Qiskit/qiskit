    Fixed a bug in :func:`~qiskit.visualization.plot_histogram` when the
    ``number_to_keep`` argument was smaller that the number of keys. The
    following code will not throw errors and will be properly aligned::

        from qiskit.visualization import plot_histogram
        data = {'00': 3, '01': 5, '11': 8, '10': 11}
        plot_histogram(data, number_to_keep=2)
