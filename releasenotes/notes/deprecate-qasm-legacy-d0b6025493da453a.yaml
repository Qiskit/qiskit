deprecations:
  - |
    The legacy OpenQASM 2 parser module previously present in :mod:`qiskit.qasm` has been
    deprecated. It will be removed in the Qiskit 1.0.0 release. The legacy
    OpenQASM 2 parser has been superseded by the :mod:`qiskit.qasm2` module
    which provides a faster more correct parser for OpenQASM 2.
  - |
    The ``qiskit.converters.ast_to_dag`` function has been deprecated and
    will be removed in the Qiskit 1.0.0 release. It previously was used to
    convert the abstract syntax tree generated by the legacy OpenQASM 2 parser
    (in the :mod:`qiskit.qasm` module which has been deprecated) and convert
    that directly to a :class:`.DAGCircuit`. As the legacy OpenQASM 2 parser
    has been deprecated this function will no longer serves a purpose after the
    legacy parser is removed. If you were previously using this, you can
    instead parse your OpenQASM 2 files into a :class:`.QuantumCircuit` using
    the :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.from_qasm_file` or
    :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.from_qasm_str` constructor methods and then
    converting that :class:`.QuantumCircuit` into a :class:`.DAGCircuit`
    with :func:`.circuit_to_dag`.
  - |
    The :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.qasm` method used to generate a OpenQASM 2
    representation of the :class:`.QuantumCircuit` object has been deprecated
    and will be removed in the Qiskit 1.0.0 release. Instead the
    :func:`.qasm2.dump` or :func:`.qasm2.dumps` functions which provide similar
    functionality should be used. If you were using the :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.qasm`
    method to generate pygments formatted output you should instead look at the standalone
    ``openqasm-pygments`` package to provide this functionality (as :func:`.qasm2.dump`
    and :func:`.qasm2.dumps` do not provide pygments colored output).
