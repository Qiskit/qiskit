    There was a problem when the function to be approximated was constant.
    The error came from trying to approximate such function with 
    numpy.polynomial.chebyshev.interpolate, which is used to approximate the
    input function. The fix avoids calling interpolate for constant functions
    but this means that such functions cannot be given in lambda type.
    Added a fix and an error message explaining how to declare constant 
    functions.
    Also updated the documentation with a message on how to declare a constant 
    function.
