    The :class:`qiskit.providers.BaseJob` class now has a new method
    :meth:`qiskit.providers.BaseJob.wait_for_final_state` that polls for the job status until the job
    reaches a final state (such as ``DONE`` or ``ERROR``). One of the parameters
    this method takes is a callback function that will be invoked during each
    polling.
