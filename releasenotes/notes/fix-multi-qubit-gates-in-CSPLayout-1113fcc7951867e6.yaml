    Added support for multi-qubit-gates to CSPLayout. CSPLayout now
    assumes for every 3+-qubit-gate we need a full connection between
    all involved qubits. CSPLayout will no longer erroneously create
    a layout for circuits with multi-qubit-gates if there is no
    suitable fully connected subgraph. Refer to 
    `#7155 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/7155>` for
    more details.
