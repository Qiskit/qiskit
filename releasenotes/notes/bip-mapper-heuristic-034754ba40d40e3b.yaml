    Added a heuristic inside the BIPMapping routing pass. The heuristic divides
    the optimization model solved by BIPMapping into smaller pieces and 
    recombines their solution, being much faster as a result. It is useful for
    circuits where the BIPMapping struggles. It can be used by setting the
    option num_splits to a value larger than 1.

    Added a way for the user to perform custom modification to the BIPMapping
    optimization model. This allows the addition of constraints such as fixing
    the position of some qubits.
