    Adds a `global_phase` attribute to `QuantumCircuit` for tracking global
    phase. This allows, for instance, to have the `to_matrix` method
    of a gate to exactly correspond to its decompositions instead of
    just up to a global phase. The same attribute has also been
    extended to DAGCircuit so the phase can be tracked when converting
    between QuantumCircuit and DAGCircuit. For example::

      from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
      circ = QuantumCircuit(1, phase=math.pi)
      circ.u1(0)

    The global phase may also be set or queried with the `circ.global_phase`
    property. In either case the setting is in radians. If the circuit
    is converted to an instruction or gate the global phase is
    represented by two single qubit rotations on the first qubit.
