    Assignment of complex values to `SymbolicPulse` instances now raises a
    `PendingDeprecationWarning`. As of Qiskit-Terra 0.23.0 all library pulses
    were converted from complex amplitude representation to real representation
    using two floats (amp,angle), as used in the `ScalableSymbolicPulse` class.
    This eliminated the need for complex parameters. Any custom-built pulses
    should be converted in a similar fashion to avoid the use of complex parameters.
