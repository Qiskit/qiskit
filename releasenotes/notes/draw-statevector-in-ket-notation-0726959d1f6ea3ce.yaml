    Allow drawing of a Statevector in latex both in vector and ket notation.
    In ket notation the entries of the statevector are processed such that 
    exact factors like fractions or sqrt of two are drawn as such.
    The old notation is still available as an option by setting the `convention` argument.

    .. code-block:: python

        from numpy import sqrt, pi, e
        from qiskit.quantum_info import Statevector
        sv=Statevector([sqrt(2)/2, 0, 0, -1/sqrt(2)])
        sv.draw(output='latex')
        sv.draw(output='latex', convention='vector') # old behaviour
