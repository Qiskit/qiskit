    Qiskit 1.4.1 is a small patch release, fixing some bugs found in the 1.4 extended support series.

  - |
    Fixed an issue with QPY 13 when serializing or deserializing a :class:`ParameterExpression`  object that was defined
    by calling :meth:`.ParameterExpression.subs` to substitute a :class:`Parameter` with a
    :class:`.ParameterExpression`. For example::
    
        from qiskit.circuit import Parameter
        
        a = Parameter("A")
        b = Parameter("B")
        expr = a + b
        c = Parameter("C")
        new_expr = c ** 3.14
        final_expr.subs({b: new_expr})
        
    In previous releases if you went to serialize a :class:`.QuantumCircuit` that contained an expression like
    this with :func:`.qpy.dump` it would have raised an ``AttributeError`` with an error message
    `'ParameterExpression' object has no attribute 'name'` when using QPY 13 (the default). This has been
    fixed so that the exception is no longer raised and you can serialize and deserialize a payload containing
    these nested :class:`.ParameterExpression` objects.
