features:
  - |
    Adds a `reshape` method to the `BaseOperator` class that allows return a
    shallow copy of an operator subclass with reshaped subsystem input or
    output dimensions. The combined dimensions of all subsystems must be the
    same as the original operator or an exception will be raised.
  - |
    Simplifies BaseOperator class so that addition, subtraction and scalar
    multiplication are no longer abstract methods. Their base class definitions
    now raise a NotImplementedError, so subclasses don't need to implement
    these methods if they don't support them.
deprecations:
  - |
    The `BaseOperator` methods have been deprecated: `add`,
    `subtract`, `multiply`. Use operators `+`, `-`, `*` to obtain previous
    functionality.
