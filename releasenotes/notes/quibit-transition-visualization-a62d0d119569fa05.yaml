    Single-qubit gate transition visualization tool. Give 
    it a single-qubit circuit and it will return an animation
    of qubit state transitions. A video codec must be installed
    on the system in order to use this feature (ffmpeg).

    Gates h,x, y, z, rx, ry, rz, s, sdg, t, tdg, u1 supported.

    Argument fpg controls how many frames will be drawn per gate
    and spg controls how many seconds animation will spend drawing
    each gate transition. Default values make animation very smooth
    but it takes longer to render in jupyter notebook because the
    animation must be rendered with a video codec.

    Optional argument trace controls whether to show trailing points
    or not. 


    Non-jupyter example::

      from qiskit.visualization import visualize_transition
      from qiskit import *

      qc = QuantumCircuit(1)
      qc.h(0)
      qc.ry(70,0)
      qc.rx(90,0)
      qc.rz(120,0)

      visualize_transition(qc)

    Jupyter example with trace::
      from qiskit.visualization import visualize_transition
      from qiskit import *

      qc = QuantumCircuit(1)
      qc.h(0)
      qc.ry(70,0)
      qc.rx(90,0)
      qc.rz(120,0)

      visualize_transition(qc, fpg=20, spg=1, trace=True)
