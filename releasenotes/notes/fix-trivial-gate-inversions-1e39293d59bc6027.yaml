    Added gate reversal directions for the symmetric :class:`~RXXGate`, :class:`~RYYGate`, and :class:`~RZZGate` gates.
    Definitions are defined by a static method to include the angle of 
    rotation as a Parameter, and gate reversal is done by simply changing
    the order of the quantum registers in the DAG.
