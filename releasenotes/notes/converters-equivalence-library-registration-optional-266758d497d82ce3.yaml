    The ``circuit_to_gate`` and ``circuit_to_instruction`` converters had
    previously automatically included the generated gate or instruction in the
    active ``SessionEquivalenceLibrary``. These converters now accept an
    optional ``equivalence_library`` keyword argument to specify if and where
    the converted instances should be registered. The default behavior is not
    to register the converted instance.
