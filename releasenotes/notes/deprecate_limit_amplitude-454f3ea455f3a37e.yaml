deprecations:
  - |
    Instantiating a :class:`Pulse` subclass instance with ``limit_amplitude`` has been deprecated.
    Though this is a constructor argument, it implicitly updates other instance settings
    since this actually updates a class variable. To avoid confusion, user must explicitly
    update the class variable. For example,

    .. code-block:: python

      from qiskit.pulse.library import Pulse, Gaussian

      Pulse.limit_amplitude = False
      waveform = Gaussian(duration=160, amp=120, sigma=40)
