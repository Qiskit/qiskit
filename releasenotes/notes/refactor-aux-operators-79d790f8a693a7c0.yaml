    A new convenience method :func:`qiskit.algorithms.eval_observables` to evaluate observables
    given a bound circuit is added. It originates from a method previously residing in
    :class:`qiskit.algorithms.VQE`. The method is general enough so that it can be used
    in other algorithms, for example time evolution algorithms. The method is also refactored to be
    more modular.
