upgrade:
  - |
    Starting in the following release of Qiskit Terra, 0.23, the ``tweedledum``
    package will become an optional dependency, instead of a requirement.  This
    is currently used by some classical phase-oracle functions.  If your
    application or library needs this functionality, you may want to prepare by
    adding ``tweedledum`` to your package's dependencies immediately.
deprecations:
  - |
    Importing the names ``Int1``, ``Int2``, ``classical_function`` and
    ``BooleanExpression`` directly from :mod:`qiskit.circuit` is deprecated.
    This is part of the move to make ``tweedledum`` an optional dependency rather
    than a full requirement.  Instead, you should import these names from
    :mod:`qiskit.circuit.classicalfunction`.
