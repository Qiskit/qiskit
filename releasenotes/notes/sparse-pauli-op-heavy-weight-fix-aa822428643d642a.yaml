    Fixed a bug where a floating point arithmetic error caused a heavy-weight 
    initialization of :class:`.SparsePauliOp` (pauli list of size > 99) without any 
    specified coeffs, to have non-zero imaginary components. The fix involved using
    modular arithmetic to set the correct coefficients based on the phase and count_y of
    the :class:`.PauliList`.
