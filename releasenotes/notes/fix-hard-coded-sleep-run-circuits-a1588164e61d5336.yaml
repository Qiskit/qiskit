    The :class:`~qiskit.utils.QuantumInstance` class used by many algorithms (like :class:`~.VQE`)
    was hard-coding the value for a sleep while it looped waiting for the job status to be updated. 
    It now respects the configured sleep value as set per the ``wait`` attribute in the 
    initializer of :class:`~qiskit.utils.QuantumInstance`.
