    The `QuantumInstance` class used by many algorithms in `qiskit.algorithms` (like VQE),
    was hard-coding the value for a sleep when it looped waiting for the job status to be
    updated. It now will respect the configured sleep value set in `QuantumInstance`.
    This is still configured in the `QuantumInstance` constructor via the `wait` value.
