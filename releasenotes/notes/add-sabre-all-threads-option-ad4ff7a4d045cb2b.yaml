    Added a new user config file option ``sabre_all_threads`` and a
    corresponding environment variable ``QISKIT_SABRE_ALL_THREADS``. When this
    flag is set the preset pass managers will run the :class:`.SabreLayout`
    and :class:`.SabreSwap` transpiler passes using all the available
    CPUs on the local system. Using this option is a tradeoff between
    determinism of output between different computers and potentially better
    output with fewer :class:`.SwapGate`\s.

    These transpiler passes run multiple random trials in parallel and pick
    the output which results in the fewest :class:`.SwapGate`\s. As a rule of
    thumb, if you run more trials, this provides the algorithm more opportunities
    to find a better result. By default, the preset pass managers use a fixed
    number of trials, in this release 5 trials for levels 0 and 1, and 20
    trials for levels 2 and 3, but these numbers may change in future releases
    (and were different in historical releases). Using a fixed number of
    trials results in deterministic results regardless of the local system,
    because even with a fixed seed if you were to default to the number of
    local CPUs available the results would different when running between
    different computers.

    If the default number of trials for a given optimization level is higher
    than the number of local CPUs it will use the optimization level default
    which is higher.
