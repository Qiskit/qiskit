    Added a new user config file option ``sabre_all_threads`` and a
    corresponding environment variable ``QISKIT_SABRE_ALL_THREADS``. When this
    flag is set the preset pass managers will run the :class:`.SabreLayout`
    and :class:`.SabreSwap` transpiler passes using all the available
    CPUs on the local system. Using this option is a tradeoff between
    determinism of output between different computers and potentially better
    output with fewer :class:`.SwapGate`\s.

    These transpiler passes run multiple random trials in parallel and pick
    the result which results in the fewest :class:`.SwapGate`\s. As a rule of
    thumb if you run more trials the provides the algorithm more opportunities
    to find a better result. By default the preset pass managers used a fixed
    number of trials, in this release 5 trials for levels 0 and 1, and 20
    trials for levels 2 and 3, but these numbers may change in future releases
    (and were different in historical releases). Using a fixed number of
    trials results in deterministic results regardless of the local system,
    because even with a fixed seed if you were to default to the number of
    local CPUs available the results would different when running between
    different computers.

    It is not recommended you use this option if your local computer has
    less than 20 CPUs as this will result in potentially degraded results
    compared to the default.
