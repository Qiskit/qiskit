    A new :class:`.DepthHeuristic` has been introduced in the :class:`.SabreSwap` pass within the 
    Qiskit transpiler. This heuristic functions similarly to existing heuristics like `"basic"`, 
    `"lookahead"`, or `"decay"`, but focuses specifically on minimizing circuit depth. By penalizing 
    swaps that would increase the circuit depth, this feature helps to route quantum circuits more 
    efficiently with potentially reduced depth.

    This new heuristic improves depth reduction for many circuits; however, one case where it
    consistently demonstrates significant improvement is for circuits with sequentially
    dependent interaction chains, such as QFT and GHZ circuits, where depth minimization is
    a priority. In these cases, depth typically outperforms lookahead in reducing circuit depth.

    To use this feature, specify `"depth"` as the heuristic in :class:`.SabreSwap`, just as 
    you would with `"basic"`, `"lookahead"`, or `"decay"`. For example:

    ```python
    from qiskit.circuit.library import QFT
    from qiskit.transpiler import CouplingMap, PassManager
    from qiskit.transpiler.passes import SabreSwap

    # Example coupling map with high connectivity
    coupling_map = CouplingMap.from_heavy_hex(5)
    qft_circuit = QFT(coupling_map.size(), do_swaps=False).decompose()

    # Use SabreSwap with the 'depth' heuristic
    pm = PassManager(SabreSwap(coupling_map, heuristic="depth"))
    result = pm.run(qft_circuit)
    ```

    This enhancement provides users with the flexibility to select the heuristic best suited for their circuit, 
    helping to improve performance by reducing overall circuit depth when depth minimization is essential.
