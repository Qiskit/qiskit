    A new :class:`.DepthHeuristic` has been introduced in the :class:`.SabreSwap` pass within the 
    Qiskit transpiler. This heuristic functions similarly to existing heuristics like `"basic"`, 
    `"lookahead"`, or `"decay"`, but focuses specifically on minimizing circuit depth. By penalizing 
    swaps that would increase the circuit depth, this feature helps to route quantum circuits more 
    efficiently with potentially reduced depth.

    To use this feature, simply specify `"depth"` as the heuristic in :class:`.SabreSwap`, just as 
    you would with `"basic"`, `"lookahead"`, or `"decay"`. For example:

    ```python
    from qiskit.transpiler import CouplingMap, PassManager
    from qiskit.transpiler.passes import SabreSwap

    coupling_map = CouplingMap.from_line(5)  # Example coupling map
    pm = PassManager(SabreSwap(coupling_map, heuristic="depth"))
    ```

    This enhancement gives users flexibility to select the heuristic best suited for their circuit, 
    helping to improve performance by reducing overall circuit depth when depth minimization is a priority.
