deprecations_providers:
  - |
    The Qobj structure and related classes (see :mod:`qiskit.qobj`) are now deprecated. They were 
    introduced as part of the :class:`.BackendV1` workflow and are no longer necessary for 
    interacting with  :class:`.BackendV2`  backends. Remote backend interaction should be done via 
    QPY (see :mod:`qiskit.qpy`) or OpenQASM (see :mod:`qiskit.qasm2` and :mod:`qiskit.qasm3`) instead.
deprecations_transpiler:
  - |
    The :func:`.assemble` function is now deprecated and will be removed in the 2.0 release.
    The function was primarily used to create a ``Qobj``, which is no longer necessary in 
    :class:`.BackendV2`-based workflows. It was also used for binding parameters, a functionality 
    fully covered by :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.assign_parameters`.
