    The :class:`.SabreLayout` transpiler pass has been updated to always run
    an additional trial using the same algorithm as :class:`.DenseLayout` to
    choose a starting point for Sabre's layout algorithm. The starting point
    used by the layout algorithm can have a large influence on the quality of
    the results. By default :class:`.SabreLayout` still start with
    ``layout_trials`` random trials but in addition there will be a single
    trial that uses the densest subgraph of the connectivity graph as the
    starting point. This may yield better results in some cases especially
    on cases with smaller circuits for larger coupling maps.
