    Fix the :class:`.SolovayKitaev` transpiler pass when loading basic
    approximations from an exising ``.npy`` file. Previously, loading
    a stored approximation which allowed for further reductions (e.g. due
    to gate cancellations) could cause a runtime failure.
    Additionally, the global phase difference of the :math:`U(2)` gate product
    and :math:`SO(3)` representation was lost during a save-reload procedure.
    Fixed `Qiskit/qiskit#12576 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/12576>`_.
