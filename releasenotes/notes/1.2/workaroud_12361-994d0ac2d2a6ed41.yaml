    The user configuration file has a new option ``circuit_idle_wires``, which takes a Boolean
    value. This allows users to set their preferred default behavior of the ``idle_wires`` option
    of the circuit drawers :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.draw` and :func:`.circuit_drawer`.  For example,
    adding a section to ``~/.qiskit/settings.conf`` with:

    .. code-block:: text
    
      [default]
      circuit_idle_wires = false

    will change the default to display the bits in reverse order.
