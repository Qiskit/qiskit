    Fixed an issue when running :func:`.transpile` or
    :meth:`~.StagedPassManager.run` on a pass manager generated by
    :func:`.generate_preset_pass_manager` using ``optimization_level`` 2 or 3
    when the ``routing_method`` argument is set to ``"none"`` to explicitly
    disable routing. Previously under these conditions the transpiler would run
    the :class:`.ElidePermutation` pass as part of the init stage as under normal
    conditions this is a useful optimization to remove :class:`.SwapGate`
    and :class:`.PermutationGate` instances from the circuit. But when
    ``routing_method="none"`` this optimization wasn't expected as it permutes
    the circuit in a similar manner to routing which shouldn't be performed
    when ``routing_method="none"``. This has been fixed by no longer
    running :class:`.ElidePermutation` if ``routing_method="none"`` is set.
    Fixed `#13144 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/13144>`__
