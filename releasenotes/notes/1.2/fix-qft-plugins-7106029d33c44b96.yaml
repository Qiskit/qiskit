    The ``HighLevelSynthesis`` transpiler pass no longer raises an exception when
    encountering a custom gate that is called "qft" but is not an instance of
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.QFTGate`. Instead, the synthesis plugins for
    QFT gates ignore such a gate, and the gate's definition is used (if provided).
