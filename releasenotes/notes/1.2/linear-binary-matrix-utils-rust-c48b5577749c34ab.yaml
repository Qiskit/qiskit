    Port internal binary matrix utils from Python to Rust, including
    binary matrix multiplication, Gaussian elimination, rank calculation,
    binary matrix inversion, and random invertible binary matrix generation.
    These functions are not part of the Qiskit API, and porting them to Rust
    improves the performance of certain synthesis methods.
