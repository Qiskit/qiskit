    The function :func:`.synth_clifford_bm` was ported to Rust. Recall that this function
    optimally synthesizes :class:`.Clifford` operators on 1, 2 or 3 qubits with respect to the
    number of CX-gates. This leads to a significant increase in performance. For Cliffords
    over 3 qubits, the speedup in on the order of 80 times.
