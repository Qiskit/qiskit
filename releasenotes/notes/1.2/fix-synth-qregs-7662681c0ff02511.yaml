    Fixed a bug where various synthesis methods created circuits without quantum or
    classical registers. This also affected functions that internally used the synthesis
    methods, such as :meth:`.Clifford.to_circuit`. While the circuits were valid, this could
    cause issues when comparing circuits with registers.
    Fixed `#13041 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/13041>`__.
