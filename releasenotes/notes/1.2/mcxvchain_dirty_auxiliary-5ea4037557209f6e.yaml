    :class:`.MCXVChain` has two new Boolean parameters `relative_phase` and `action_only`.
    If `action_only` the circuit does not clean the dirty qubits. If `relative_phase`
    the gate is implemented up to a global phase. Both parameters are used to optimize the
    decomposition of MCXVChain.
fixes:
  - |
    :class:`.MCXVChain` with k controls and k-2 dirty auxiliary qubits now requires 8k-6 cx gates.
