    :class:`.MCXVChain` has two new Boolean parameters `relative_phase` and `action_only`.
    If ``action_only`` is ``True`` the circuit does not clean the dirty qubits. If ``relative_phase``
    is ``True`` the gate is implemented up to a global phase. Both parameters are used to optimize the
    decomposition of :class:`.MCXVChain`.

    :class:`.MCXVChain` with :math:`k` controls and :math:`k-2` dirty auxiliary qubits now 
    requires :math:`8k-6` CX gates.
