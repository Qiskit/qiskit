    The :func:`.random_circuit` function has a new feature where
    users can specify a distribution ``num_operand_distribution`` (a dict) that specifies the
    ratio of 1-qubit, 2-qubit, 3-qubit, and 4-qubit gates in the random circuit. For example,
    if ``num_operand_distribution = {1: 0.25, 2: 0.25, 3: 0.25, 4: 0.25}`` is passed to the function
    then the generated circuit will have approximately 25% of 1-qubit, 2-qubit, 3-qubit, and
    4-qubit gates. Also it should be noted that the if ``num_operand_distribution`` is not specified
    then ``max_operands`` will default to 4 and a random circuit with a random gate distribution will 
    be generated. If both ``num_operand_distribution`` and ``max_operands`` are specified at the same 
    time then ``num_operand_distribution`` will be used to generate the random circuit.

    Example usage:
        
    .. plot::
       :include-source:

       from qiskit.circuit.random import random_circuit

       circ = random_circuit(
         num_qubits=6, depth=5, num_operand_distribution={1: 0.25, 2: 0.25, 3: 0.25, 4: 0.25}
       )
       circ.draw(output="mpl")
