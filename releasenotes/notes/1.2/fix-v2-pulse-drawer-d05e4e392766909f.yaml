    Fixed a bug in :func:`~qiskit.visualization.pulse_v2.interface.draw` that did not
    draw pulse schedules when the draw function was called with a :class:`.BackendV2` argument.
    Because the V2 backend does not report hardware channel frequencies,
    the generated drawing will show ``no freq.`` below each channel label.
