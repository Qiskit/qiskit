    The OpenQASM 3 exporter has restored its behavior of accepting non-standard-library include
    files in the ``includes`` argument to :func:`.qasm3.dump`, :func:`~.qasm3.dumps`, and
    :class:`~.qasm3.Exporter`.  These will insert a suitable ``include`` statement into the output
    as before, and the exporter remains unaware of the intended gates in that include file; you
    should pass the gates you expect it to define in the ``basis_gates`` argument to the same functions.

    We expect to improve the export mechanism against non-standard include files in a future release
    of Qiskit.
