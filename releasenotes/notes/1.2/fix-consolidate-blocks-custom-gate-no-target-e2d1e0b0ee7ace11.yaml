    Fixed a bug in the :class:`.ConsolidateBlocks` transpiler pass, when the
    input circuit contains a custom opaque gate and neither the
    ``basis_gates`` or ``target`` options are set the pass would raise a
    ``QiskitError`` and fail. This has been corrected so that the in these
    situations the transpiler pass will not consolidate the block identified
    containing a custom gate instead of failing.
