    The :class:`.BackendV1` class is deprecated and it will be removed not earlier than the next major release.
    There are several migration paths available depending on the main purpose of the backend object::

      - To expose backend information with no access to execution (just a hardware description), consider constructing a :class:`.Target` directly.
      - To provides access to execution capabilities, consider relying on the primitives interfaces instead.
      - Alternatively, to continue providing simultaneous :class:`.Target` (hardware information) and ``run`` (execution) capabilities, consider moving to :class:`.BackendV2` (see <https://qisk.it/backendV1-to-V2>).

  - |
    The models in :mod:`qiskit.providers.models` are part of the deprecated :class:`.BackendV1` workflow
    and no longer necessary for :class:`.BackendV2`. If a user workflow requires these representations it
    likely relies on deprecated functionality and should be updated to use :class:`.BackendV2`.
