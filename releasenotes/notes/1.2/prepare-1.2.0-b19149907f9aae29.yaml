    The Qiskit 1.2.0 release focuses mainly on improving performance
    and quality of the compiler. Also, it is the last release supporting
    Python 3.8. By Qiskit 1.3.0 the minimal required Python version
    will be 3.9.

    Among a wide range of new features, improvements, and fixes, the release highlights are:

      * The circuit infrastructure, including gates and operations, is moved
        to Rust. This enables a series of speedups in circuit construction
        and circuit manipulation.

      * Leveraging the above point, parts of the synthesis library are now
        constructing circuits in Rust. This produces a significant speedup
        when synthesizing operations such as Cliffords, permutations, or linear functions.
        As example, decomposing 50+ qubit Cliffords benefit from an
        approximate 1000-fold speedup in runtime.

      * The default ``optimization`` level has changed from 1 to 2 in
        :func:`.transpile` and :func:`.generate_preset_pass_manager`.
        This will generally improve the quality of the compiled circuits,
        at an additional runtime cost. For most users, level 2 is likely to
        present the optimal trade-off.

      * The default quality of compiled circuits is improved by optimizing
        with a unitary peephole optimization and using a dense layout as a
        Sabre trial.
