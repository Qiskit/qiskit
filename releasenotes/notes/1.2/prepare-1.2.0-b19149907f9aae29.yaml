    The Qiskit 1.2.0 release focuses mainly on improving performance
    and quality of the compiler. Also, it is the last release supporting
    Python 3.8. By Qiskit 1.3.0 the minimal required Python version
    will be 3.9.

    Among a wide range of new features, improvements, and fixes, the release highlights are:

      * The circuit infrastructure, including gates and operations, is moved
        to Rust. This enables a series of speedups in circuit construction
        and circuit manipulation.

      * Leveraging the above point, parts of the synthesis library are now
        constructing circuits in Rust. This produces a significant speedup
        when synthesizing operations such as Cliffords, permutations, or linear functions.
        As example, decomposing 50+ qubit Cliffords benefit from an
        approximate 1000-fold speedup in runtime.

      * The quality of compiled circuits is improved by optimizing with a unitary peephole 
        optimization at the initial stage of the transpilation workflow (at optimization level 
        ``>1``), and by using a dense layout as a Sabre layouting trial (at optimization level ``>0``).
