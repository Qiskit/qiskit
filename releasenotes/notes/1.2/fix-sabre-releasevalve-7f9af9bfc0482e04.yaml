    Fixed an edge case in :class:`.SabreLayout`, where in rare cases on large
    devices and challenging circuits, the routing would fail. This was due to the 
    release valve making more than one two-qubit gate routable, where only one was expected.
    Fixed `#13081 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/13081>`__.
