    The internal symbol table of the OpenQASM 3 exporter (:mod:`qiskit.qasm3`) has been rewritten,
    which should result in cleaner outputs when using Qiskit standard-library gates that are not in
    the OpenQASM 3 standard-library headers, and more deterministic outputs.  For example, using
    several :class:`.RZXGate`\ s will now result in only a single parametric definition, and when
    naming collisions occur, the symbol table will assign a deterministic counter to make names
    unique, rather than a non-deterministic integer (previously, the object identity was used).
fixes:
  - |
    The OpenQASM 3 exporter (:mod:`qiskit.qasm3`) will now correctly export multiple instances of
    :class:`.PauliEvolutionGate` from a circuit.  Previously, only a single instance would be exported,
    and all other instances would silently use the same (incorrect) version.
  - |
    The OpenQASM 3 exporter (:mod:`qiskit.qasm3`) will now correctly escape gate names.  Previously,
    a gate whose name was an invalid OpenQASM 3 identifier would cause invalid OpenQASM 3 to be
    generated.
