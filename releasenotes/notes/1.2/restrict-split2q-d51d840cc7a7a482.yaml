    Fixed an edge case when transpiling a circuit with ``optimization_level`` 2 or 3 with an
    incomplete 1-qubit basis gate set on a circuit containing 2-qubit gates, that can be
    implemented as a product of single qubit gates. This bug is resolved by restricting
    :class:`.Split2QUnitaries` to consider only :class:`.UnitaryGate` objects.
    Fixed `#12970 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/12970>`__.
