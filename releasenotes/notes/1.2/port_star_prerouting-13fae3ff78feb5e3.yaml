features_transpiler:
  - |
    Port part of the logic from the :class:`.StarPreRouting`, used to 
    find a star graph connectivity subcircuit and replaces it with a 
    linear routing equivalent.
  - | 
    The performance of :meth:`.StartPreRouting.star_preroute` is improved by performing the heavy 
    lifting to transform the DAG in Rust space.
