    The following circuit methods were not intended for public use, but were accidentally left documented in the
    public API during the 1.0 release. They are now deprecated from Qiskit 1.2 and will be removed in Qiskit 2.0:

      * ``QuantumCircuit.cast``
      * ``QuantumCircuit.cls_instances``
      * ``QuantumCircuit.cls_prefix``
      * ``QuantumCircuit.cbit_argument_conversion``
      * ``QuantumCircuit.qbit_argument_conversion``
