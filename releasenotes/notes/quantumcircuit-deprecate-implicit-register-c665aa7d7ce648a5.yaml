    Initializing a QuantumCircuit with only the number of qubits and clbits previously
    implicitly created a QuantumRegister("q") and optionally ClassicalRegister("c")
    and added them to the circuit. This behavior has been deprecated and will be
    removed in a future release. Instead, the circuit will be created with the correct
    number of registerless qubits and clbits.
