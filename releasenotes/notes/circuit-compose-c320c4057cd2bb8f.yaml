features:
  - |
    A new ``compose`` method is added to ``QuantumCircuit``. It allows
    composition of two quantum circuits without having to turn one into
    a gate or instruction. It also allows permutations of qubits/clbits
    at the point of composition, as well as optional inplace modification.
    It can also be used in place of ``circuit.append()``, as it allows
    composing instructions and operators onto the circuit as well.
deprecations:
  - |
    The ``DAGCircuit.compose()`` method now takes a list of qubits/clbits
    that specify the positional order of bits to compose onto. The
    dictionary-based method of mapping using ``edge_map`` arg is
    deprecated.
