build:
  - The minimum version of CMake required to build and run the C-API test suite has been lowered to
    3.20 from 3.27.  Qiskit does not commit to any particular policy around the version of CMake
    required, but will make a best-effort attempt to match the repositories of common and
    still-supported Linux distributions.
