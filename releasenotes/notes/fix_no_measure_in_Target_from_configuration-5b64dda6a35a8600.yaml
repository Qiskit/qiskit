upgrade:
  - |
    Added :class:`.QubitProperties` in :class:`.Target`.
    One can access :class:`.QubitProperties` for a particular :class:`.Target` object by calling it's
    method :meth:`.Target.qubit_properties`.
    
    If no mapping is available for a specified :code:`basis_gate`, this raises :class:`.TranspilerError`.

fixes:
  - |
    Fixed an issue with :meth:`.Target.form_configuration` method in :class:`.Target` when attempting to get
    the :code:`Target` object, the measure instruction was missing.
    Refer to `#10168 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/10168>` for more information.
