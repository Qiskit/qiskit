    The transpiler pass :class:`.LookaheadSwap` (used by :func:`.transpile` when
    ``routing_method="lookahead"``) has seen some performance improvements and
    will now be approximately three times as fast.  This is purely being more
    efficient in its calculations, and does not change the complexity of the
    algorithm.  In most cases, a more modern routing algorithm like
    :class:`.SabreSwap` (``routing_method="sabre"``) will be vastly more
    performant.
