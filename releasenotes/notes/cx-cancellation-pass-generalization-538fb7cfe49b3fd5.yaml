    Introduced a new feature ``Cancellation`` that generalizes the ``CXCancellation`` 
    pass to cancel any self-inverse gates or gate-inverse pairs. It can be used by 
    initializing ``Cancellation`` and passing a gate to cancel, for example::

      from qiskit.transpiler.passes import Cancellation
      from qiskit.circuit.library import HGate
      Cancellation([HGate])
