    Introduced a new feature ``InverseCancellation`` that generalizes the ``CXInverseCancellation`` 
    pass to cancel any self-inverse gates or gate-inverse pairs. It can be used by 
    initializing ``InverseCancellation`` and passing a gate to cancel, for example::

      from qiskit.transpiler.passes import InverseCancellation
      from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
      from qiskit.circuit.library import HGate
      from qiskit.transpiler import PassManager
      qc = QuantumCircuit(2, 2)
      qc.h(0)
      qc.h(0)
      pass_ = InverseCancellation([HGate()])
      pm = PassManager(pass_)
      new_circ = pm.run(qc)
