    A new function, :func:`qiskit.utils.should_run_in_parallel`, is available to determine whether
    :func:`.parallel_map` will choose to run in parallel or degrade to running in serial.  This
    decision is dependent on how many CPUs are available to Qiskit, what the :mod:`multiprocessing`
    start method is, how many processes were requested.

    :meth:`.PassManager.run` will no longer waste time serializing itself when given multiple inputs
    if it is only going to work in serial.
