features:
  - |
    The gate map visualizations in the ``qiskit.visualization.gate_map`` file have been
    improved for rendering layouts of large backends. The plots are now rendered as a PIL image
    instead of a Matplotlib Figure. If a `filename` is provided, the high-res PIL image is directly 
    saved. Otherwise, it is converted to a Matplotlib figure.

    The gate map visualization methods
    The plotting functions in the ``qiskit.visualization.gate_map`` file now use the function
    func:`~rustworkx.graphviz_draw` instead of matplotlib to render the plots. In case `qubit_coordinates` 
    is not available in the function :func:`~qiskit.visualization.plot_gate_map`, the  
    func:~`rustworkx.spring_layout` function is not used for the graph layout anymore; instead the
    `func:~rustworkx.graphviz_draw` function automatically renders the layout. 
    This allows the effective layout rendering of large graphs. 
    As the visualization methods now rely on graphviz, install it before using them.  
    Fixes `#9031 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/9031>`__.
