    The method :meth:`~qiskit.transpiler.CouplingMap.reduce` now accepts an
    additional argument ``check_if_connected``, defaulted to ``True``. This
    corresponds to the previous behavior, checking whether the reduced coupling
    map remains connected and raising a ``CouplingError`` if not so. When set to
    ``False``, the check is skipped, allowing disconnected reduced coupling maps.
