    Fixes return of improper Schedule by Backend.instruction_schedule_map.get('measure', [0])

    .. code-block:: python

      #import a fake backend which is a sub-class of BackendV2.
      from qiskit.providers.fake_provider import FakePerth
      backend = FakePerth()
      sched = backend.instruction_schedule_map.get('measure', [0])

    The issue was that the :code:`sched` contained Schedule for measure operation on
    all qubits of the backend instead of having the Schedule for measure operation
    on just qubit_0.
