features:
  - |
    The performance of :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.assign_parameters` and :meth:`~.QuantumCircuit.bind_parameters`
    has significantly increased for large circuits with structures typical of applications uses.
    This includes most circuits based on the :class:`.NLocal` structure, such as
    :class:`.EfficientSU2`.  See `#10282 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/10282>`__ for more
    detail.
fixes:
  - |
    A parametrised circuit that contains a custom gate whose definition has a parametrised global phase
    can now successfully bind the parameter in the inner global phase.
    See `#10283 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/10283>`__ for more detail.
