    Added new functions for running transpiler stages to the C API. These
    functions are:

      * :c:func:`qk_transpile_stage_init`
      * :c:func:`qk_transpile_stage_layout`
      * :c:func:`qk_transpile_stage_translation`
      * :c:func:`qk_transpile_stage_optimization`

    run the :ref:`transpiler-preset-stage-init`, :ref:`transpiler-preset-stage-layout`,
    :ref:`transpiler-preset-stage-translation`, and
    :ref:`transpiler-preset-stage-optimization` respectively.
    These function are used to run these stages from the preset pass manager
    on a ``QkDag`` object. The goal of these functions are to enable composable
    transpilation workflows from C when combined with custom transpiler passes.
