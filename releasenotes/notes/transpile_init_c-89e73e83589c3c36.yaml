    Added a new function :cpp:func:`qk_transpile_stage_init` to the C API.
    This function is used to run the init stage from the preset pass manager
    on a ``QkDag`` object. The goal of this function is to enable composable
    transpilation workflows from C when combined with custom transpiler passes.
