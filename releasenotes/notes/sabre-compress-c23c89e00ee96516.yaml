    The implementation of Sabre routing used by :class:`.SabreLayout` and :class:`.SabreSwap` now
    compresses runs of nodes that will automatically become eligible for routing at the same time
    within its internal virtual-interaction representation.  This improves the efficiency of the
    routing, reduces intermediate memory use, and avoids runs of 2q gates biasing the ``lookahead``
    heuristic components.
