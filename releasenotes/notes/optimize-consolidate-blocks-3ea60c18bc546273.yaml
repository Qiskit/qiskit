    Reduced overhead of the :class:`.ConsolidateBlocks` pass by performing matrix operations
    on all two-qubit blocks privately instead of creating an instance of :class:`.QuantumCircuit`
    and passing it to an :class:`.Operator`. The speedup will only be applicable when 
    consolidating two-qubit blocks. Anything higher than that will still be handled by the 
    :class:`.Operator` class.
