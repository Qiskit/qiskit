features:
  - |
    Added a new gate :class:`.LinearFunction` that efficiently encodes a linear function (that is,
    a function that can be represented by a sequence of :class:`.CXGate` and :class:`.SwapGate` gates).
  - |
    Added a new transpiler pass :class:`.CollectLinearFunctions` that collects blocks of consecutive
    :class:`.CXGate` and :class:`.SwapGate` gates, and replaces each block by a :class:`.LinearFunction` gate.
  - |
    Added a new transpiler pass :class:`.LinearFunctionsSynthesis`
    that synthesizes :class:`.LinearFunction` gates using the Patel-Markov-Hayes algorithm.
  - |
    Added a new transpiler pass :class:`.LinearFunctionsToPermutations` that replaces a
    :class:`.LinearFunction` gate by a :class:`.Permutation` circuit whenever possible.
