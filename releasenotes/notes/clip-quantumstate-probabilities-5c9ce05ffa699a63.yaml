fixes:
  - |
    Clip probabilities in the :meth:`.QuantumState.probabilities` and 
    :meth:`.QuantumState.probabilities_dict` methods to the interval ``[0, 1]``.
    This fixes roundoff errors where probabilities could e.g. be larger than 1, leading 
    to errors in the shot emulation of the :class:`.Sampler`.
    Fixed `#9761 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/9761>`__.
