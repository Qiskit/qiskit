    Fixed an issue causing an error when binding a complex parameter value to an operator's
    coefficient. Casts to ``float`` in :class:`~qiskit.opflow.primitive_ops.PrimitiveOp`
    and :class:`~qiskit.extensions.HamiltonianGate` were generalized to casts to ``complex``.
    Fixes `#6889 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/6976>`__.
