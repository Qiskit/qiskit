    The :meth:`~Clifford.to_circuit` method now uses a non-optimal
    greedy compilation routine for Clifford elements synthesis, by Bravyi et. al.,
    which typically yields better CX cost compared to the previousely
    used Aaronson-Gottesman method (for more than two qubits).
    This is now the default method for Clifford circuit synthesis of more
    than three qubits, unless another method is specified.
