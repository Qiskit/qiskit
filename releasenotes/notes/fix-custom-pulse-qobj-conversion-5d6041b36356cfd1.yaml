    Fixed a bug in the conversion of custom pulse instructions to ``Qobj``. The bug was introduced in Qiskit 1.0.0
    and caused conversion of custom pulse instructions to raise an error. After the fix, the conversion is
    carried out correctly, and the custom pulse is converted to ``Waveform`` as it should.
    Fixed `#11828 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/11828>`__.
