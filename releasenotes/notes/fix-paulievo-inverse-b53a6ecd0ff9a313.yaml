    Fix :meth:`~qiskit.circuit.library.PauliEvolutionGate.inverse` which previously computed the
    inverse by inverting the evolution time, which is only the correct inverse if the operator
    was involved correctly. In particular, this led to the inverse of Trotterization-based time
    evolutions being incorrect.
