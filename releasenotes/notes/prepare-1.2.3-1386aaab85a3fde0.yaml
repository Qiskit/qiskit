    Qiskit 1.2.3 is a patch release fixing a problem in QPY that could cause files generated by
    one Python environment to fail to load in a different Python environment, despite the format
    supposedly being transferable.  This is related to differences in the version of the library
    ``symengine``, which QPY should have protected against.
