deprecations:
  - |
    The Jupyter magic ``%circuit_library_info`` and the objects in ``qiskit.tools.jupyter.library``
    it calls in turn:

    - ``circuit_data_table``
    - ``properties_widget``
    - ``qasm_widget``
    - ``circuit_digram_widget``
    - ``circuit_library_widget``

    are deprecated and will be removed in Terra 0.27.  These objects were only intended for use in
    the documentation build. They are no longer used there, so are no longer supported or maintained.
