    When transpiling to the Clifford+T basis, the :class:`.UnitarySynthesis`
    transpiler pass now uses a Clifford+T synthesis algorithm by default to 
    approximate single-qubit unitaries.

    Similarly, the :class:`~.DefaultUnitarySynthesis` plugin now uses the
    same Clifford+T synthesis algorithm to approximate single-qubit unitaries.
