    An edge case of pickle :class:`.InstructionScheduleMap` with
    non-picklable iterable ``arguments`` is supported.
    When :meth:`InstructionScheduleMap.add` is called with
    ``arguments``, this method typecasts the user value to a python list
    to guarantee the added entry is picklable.
    For example, a user may supply a python dict keys as ``arguments``.
    This also guarantees parallel transpile works with such a custom
    instruction schedule map, where the map object is pickled and
    distributed to every parallel threads.
