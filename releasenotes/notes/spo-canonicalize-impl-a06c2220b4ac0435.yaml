    The internal algorithm used by :func:`.SparseObservable.canonicalize` changed to use hash-maps
    and a subsequent sort, instead of on-the-fly B-tree based sorting during the mapping.  The
    scaling of the algorithm and the results should be unchanged, but the practical performance,
    especially for very large observables, has improved.
