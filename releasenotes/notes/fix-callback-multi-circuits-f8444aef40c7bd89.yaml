    Fixed a bug in ``PassManager.run()`` where the ``callback`` function was not
    invoked when running with multiple circuits. The callback is now correctly
    triggered for each pass on each circuit, including in parallel execution.
    The fix is validated through a unit test that also demonstrates the use of
    a lambda callback, and highlights the expected behavior under parallelism.
