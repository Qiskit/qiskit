    The plugin name ``default`` is reserved for the :ref:`stage_table`
    ``init``, ``layout``, ``optimization``, and ``scheduling``. These stages previously
    did not reserve this plugin name, but the ``default`` name is now used to
    represent Qiskit's built-in default method for these stages. If you were
    using these names for plugins on these stages these will conflict with
    Qiskit's usage and you should rename your plugin.
