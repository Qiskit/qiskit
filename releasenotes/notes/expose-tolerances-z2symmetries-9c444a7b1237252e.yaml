    The :class:`~qiskit.opflow.Z2Symmetries` class now exposes the threshold 
    tolerances, ``atol`` and ``rtol``, used to truncate small coefficients.
    With this one can control how the coefficients of the tapered operator are 
    simplified. For example::

        from qiskit.opflow import Z2Symmetries
        from qiskit.quantum_info import Pauli

        z2_symmetries = Z2Symmetries(
            symmetries=[Pauli("IIZI"), Pauli("IZIZ"), Pauli("ZIII")],
            sq_paulis=[Pauli("IIXI"), Pauli("IIIX"), Pauli("XIII")],
            sq_list=[1, 0, 3],
            tapering_values=[1, -1, -1],
            atol=1e-10,
            rtol=1e-8,
        )


    Per default, the standard cutoff tolerances of the :class:`~qiskit.quantum_info.SparsePauliOp`
    are used.

    The :meth:`qiskit.quantum_info.SparsePauliOp.simplify` method now truncates real and 
    imaginary parts of coefficients individually. Before, coefficients were only reduced if the
    absolute value as below the threshold. For example, before the coefficients `[1+1e-17j, 1e-17j]`
    were reduced to `[1+1e-17j, 0]` but now are reduced to `[1, 0]`.
