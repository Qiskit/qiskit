    Fix :class:`~qiskit.transpiler.passes.Optimize1qGates` producing an empty,
    unnamed instruction when the target basis does not include "u". The pass
    previously copied a "u" label through a "nop" rewrite without remapping,
    leaving a default unnamed gate and potentially changing semantics. The pass
    now guards the "nop" path with the basis check and remaps to a valid gate
    (e.g. U3Gate), avoiding unnamed instructions.
