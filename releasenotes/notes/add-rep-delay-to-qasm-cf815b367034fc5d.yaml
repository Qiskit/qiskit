    ``rep_delay`` has been added to the QASM qobj. This parameter is used to denote the time between
    program executions. It must be chosen from the backend range given by
    ``backend.configuration().rep_delay_range``. If a value is not provided, a backend default
    ``backend.configuration().default_rep_delay`` will be used.

    ``rep_delay`` will only work on backends which allow for dynamic repetition time. This is
    defined via ``backend.configuration().dynamic_reprate_enabled``.

    The ``qobj_schema.json`` JSON Schema file in :mod:`qiskit.schemas` has
    been updated to include the ``rep_delay`` as an optional configuration
    property for qasm qobjs.

    configuration.
