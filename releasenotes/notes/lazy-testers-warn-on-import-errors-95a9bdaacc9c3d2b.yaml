features:
  - |
    A new warning base class, :exc:`.QiskitWarning`, was added.  While Qiskit will continue to use
    built-in Python warnings (such as :exc:`DeprecationWarning`) when those are most appropriate,
    for cases that are more specific to Qiskit, the warnings will be subclasses of :exc:`.QiskitWarning`.
  - |
    :exc:`.QPYLoadingDeprecatedFeatureWarning` is now a subclass of :exc:`.QiskitWarning`.
  - |
    The optional-functionality testers (:mod:`qiskit.utils.optionals`) will now distinguish an
    optional dependency that was completely not found (a normal situation) with one that was found,
    but triggered errors during its import.  In the latter case, they will now issue an
    :exc:`.OptionalDependencyImportWarning` telling you what happened, since it might indicate a
    failed installation or an incompatible version.
