    The methods :meth:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.power`,
    :meth:`~qiskit.circuit.Gate.power`, as well as the similar methods
    of subclasses of :class:`~qiskit.circuit.Gate`
    (such as of :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.SGate`) all have an additional
    argument ``annotated``.
    The default value of ``False`` corresponds to the existing behavior.
    Furthermore, for standard gates with an explicitly defined ``power`` method,
    the argument ``annotated`` has no effect, for example both
    ``SGate().power(1.5, annotated=False)`` and ``SGate().power(1.5, annotated=True)``
    return a ``PhaseGate``.
    The difference manifests for gates without an explicitly defined
    power method. The value of ``False`` returns a
    :class:`~.library.UnitaryGate`, just as before, while the value of ``True``
    returns an :class:`~.AnnotatedOperation` that represents the instruction
    modified with the "power modifier".
