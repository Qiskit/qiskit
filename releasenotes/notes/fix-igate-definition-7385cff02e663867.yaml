    Fixed a bug where certain operations, such as
    :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.control`, would crash if an identity operation
    represented by an :class:`.IGate` was present in a :class:`.QuantumCircuit`.
    For example, the following code was previously an error, but will now function
    correctly::

        from qiskit import QuantumCircuit

        qc = QuantumCircuit(1)
        qc.i(0)
        controlled = qc.control()

    Qiskit Terra will now generally treat the identity gate :class:`.IGate` (with corresponding
    circuit method :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.i`) as a quantum no-op, and more aggressively remove it
    during calls to :func:`.transpile`.  This is a change to previous behaviour that supported
    legacy IBM Quantum systems where the ``id`` instruction was a short-hand for the shortest
    possible delay cycle.

    This changes removes a lot of surprises when working with :class:`.IGate` at a high-level;
    various circuit and synthesis operations would previously be unable to handle the gate because
    it appeared as a "magic" opaque instruction.
