    Fixed a bug where certain operations, such as
    :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.control`, would crash if an identity operation
    represented by an :class:`.IGate` was present in a :class:`.QuantumCircuit`.
    For example, the following code was previously an error, but will now function
    correctly::

        from qiskit import QuantumCircuit

        qc = QuantumCircuit(1)
        qc.i(0)
        controlled = qc.control()
