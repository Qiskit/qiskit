    A new environment variable ``QISKIT_SUPPRESS_PACKAGING_WARNINGS`` can be
    set to ``Y`` or ``y`` which will suppress the warnings about
    ``qiskit-aer`` and ``qiskit-ibmq-provider`` not being installed at import
    time. This is useful for users who are only running qiskit-terra (or just
    not qiskit-aer and/or qiskit-ibmq-provider) and the warnings are not an
    indication of a potential packaging problem. You can set the environment
    variable to ``N`` or ``n`` to ensure that warnings are always enabled
    even if the user config file is set to disable them.

    A new user config file option, ``suppress_packaging_warnings`` has been
    added. When set to ``true`` in your user config file like::

        [default]
        suppress_packaging_warnings = true

    it will suppress the warnings about  ``qiskit-aer`` and
    ``qiskit-ibmq-provider`` not being installed at import time. This is useful
    for users who are only running qiskit-terra (or just not qiskit-aer and/or
    qiskit-ibmq-provider) and the warnings are not an indication of a potential
    packaging problem. If the user config file is set to disable the warnings
    this can be overriden by setting the ``QISKIT_SUPPRESS_PACKAGING_WARNINGS``
    to ``N`` or ``n``
