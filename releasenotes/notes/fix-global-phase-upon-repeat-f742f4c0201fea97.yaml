    Fix the global phase of the output of ``circuit.repeat``. If a circuit with global
    phase is appended to another circuit, the global phase is currently not propagated.
    The simulators rely on this, since the phase otherwise gets applied multiple times.
    This sets the global phase of ``circuit.repeat`` to 0 instead of multiplying the existing
    phase times the number of repetitions.
