    The :class:`.SabreLayout` transpiler pass has been updated to run an
    additional 2 or 3 layout trials by default independently of the
    ``layout_trials`` keyword argument's value. A trivial
    layout and its reverse are included for all backends, just like the :class:`.DenseLayout`
    trial that was added in 1.2.0. In addition to this, the largest rings on 
    an IBM backend heavy hex connectivity graph are added if the backends are 127,
    133, or 156 qubits. This can provide a good starting point for some circuits on these commonly run
    backends, while for all others it's just an additional "random trial".
