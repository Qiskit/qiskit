    The :class:`.SabreLayout` transpiler pass has been updated to run an
    additional 2 or 3 layout trials by default independently of the
    ``layout_trials`` keyword argument's value. For all backends a trivial
    layout and it's reverse are included just like the :class:`.DenseLayout`
    trial that were added in 1.2.0. In addition if the backends are 127,
    133, or 156 qubits the largest rings on an IBM backend heavy hex
    connectivity graph are added. On those backends which are commonly run
    this can provide a good starting point for some circuits on these
    backends and for all others it's just an additional random trial.
