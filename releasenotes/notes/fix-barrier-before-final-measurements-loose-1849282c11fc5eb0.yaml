    Fixed the :class:`.BarrierBeforeFinalMeasurements` transpiler pass when there
    are conditions on loose :class:`.Clbit`\ s immediately before the final measurement
    layer.  Previously, this would fail claiming that the bit was not present
    in an internal temporary circuit.
    Fixed `#8923 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/8923>`__
