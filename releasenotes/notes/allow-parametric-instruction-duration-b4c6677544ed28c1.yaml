upgrade:
  - |
    Pulse `Instruction` object and `ParametricPulse` object now support parameter objects
    as `duration`.

    .. code-block:: python

      dur = Parameter('x_pulse_duration')
      rx_pulse = Gaussian(dur, 0.1, dur/4)

    Note that we cannot add this instruction to `Schedule` because of the evaluation of
    instruction overlap constraints. We will implement new program representation
    that allows lazy instruction scheduling with parameterized durations.
