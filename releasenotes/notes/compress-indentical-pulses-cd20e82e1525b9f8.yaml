    Schedule transformer :func:`qiskit.pulse.reschedule.compress_pulses`
    performs an optimization pass to reduce the usage of waveform
    memory in hardware by replacing multiple identical instances of
    a pulse in a pulse schedule with a single pulse.
    For example::

        from qiskit.pulse import reschedule

        schedules = []
        for _ in range(2):
            schedule = Schedule()
            drive_channel = DriveChannel(0)
            schedule += Play(SamplePulse([0.0, 0.1]), drive_channel)
            schedule += Play(SamplePulse([0.0, 0.1]), drive_channel)
            schedules.append(schedule)

        compressed_schedules = reschedule.compress_pulses(schedules)
