features:
  - |
    Added ``dot`` as an abstract method to the ``BaseOperator`` class and hence
    to ``Operator`` and ``QuantumChannel`` classes. This method returns the
    right operator multiplication ``a.dot(b) = a * b``. It is equivalent to
    calling the operator ``compose`` method with kwarg ``front=True``.
upgrade:
  - |
    Changed operator magic methods so that ``__mul__`` implements right matrix
    multiplication ``dot``, and ``__rmul__`` implements scalar multiplication
    ``multiply``. Previously both implemented scalar multiplciation.
