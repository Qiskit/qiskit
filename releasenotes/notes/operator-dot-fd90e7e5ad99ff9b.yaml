features:
  - |
    Added ``dot`` as an abstract method to the ``BaseOperator`` class and hence
    to ``Operator`` and ``QuantumChannel`` classes. This method returns the
    right operator multiplication ``a.dot(b) = a * b``.
upgrade:
  - |
    Changed operator magic methods so that ``__mul__`` implements right matrix
    multiplication ``dot``, and ``__rmul__`` implements scalar multiplication
    ``multiply``. Previously both implemented scalar multiplciation.
deprecations:
  - |
    Deprecated the ``front`` kwarg of operator method ``compose``. This
    functionality is replaced by the ``dot`` operator method:
    ``a.compose(b, front=True) == a.dot(b)``. Compose is intended to be
    used for left operator multiplication only, while right operator
    multiplication should be implemented with the new ``dot`` method.
