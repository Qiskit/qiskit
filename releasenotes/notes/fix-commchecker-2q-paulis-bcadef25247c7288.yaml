    Fixed a bug in the :class:`.CommutationChecker` which could fail upon checking the commutation
    relation of a two-qubit Pauli rotation with a gate that is not in the commutation cache.
    For example::

      import numpy as np
      from qiskit.circuit.library import RXXGate, RGate
      from qiskit.circuit.commutation_library import SessionCommutationChecker as scc

      res = scc.commute(RGate(2, 2), [1], [], RXXGate(np.pi / 2), [0, 1], [])

    This behavior is now resolved and the commutation relation correctly computed.
    Fixed `#13742 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/13742>`__.
