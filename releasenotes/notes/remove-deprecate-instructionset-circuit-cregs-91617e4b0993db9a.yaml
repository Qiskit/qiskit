    The deprecated ``circuit_cregs`` argument to the constructor for the
    :class:`~.InstructionSet` class has been removed. It was deprecated in the
    0.19.0 release. If you were using this argument and manually constructing
    an :class:`~.InstructionSet` object (which should be quite uncommon as it's
    mostly used internally) you should pass a callable to the
    ``resource_requester`` keyword argument instead. For example::

        from qiskit.circuit import Clbit, ClassicalRegister, InstructionSet
        from qiskit.circuit.exceptions import CircuitError

        def my_requester(bits, registers):
            bits_set = set(bits)
            bits_flat = tuple(bits)
            registers_set = set(registers)

            def requester(specifier):
                if isinstance(specifer, Clbit) and specifier in bits_set:
                    return specifier
                if isinstance(specifer, ClassicalRegster) and specifier in register_set:
                    return specifier
                if isinstance(specifier, int) and 0 <= specifier < len(bits_flat):
                    return bits_flat[specifier]
                raise CircuitError(f"Unknown resource: {specifier}")

            return requester

        my_bits = [Clbit() for _ in [None]*5]
        my_registers = [ClassicalRegister(n) for n in range(3)]

        InstructionSet(resource_requester=my_requester(my_bits, my_registers))
