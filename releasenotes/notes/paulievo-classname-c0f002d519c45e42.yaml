    Update the name of :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.PauliEvolutionGate` to 
    ``"PauliEvolution"``. This change is consistent with other gates in Qiskit
    and e.g. allows unrolling to Pauli evolution gates.

    Previously, the name contained the operators which are evolved, which is
    now available via :meth:`~qiskit.circuit.library.PauliEvolutionGate.label`. 
    If a circuit with a Pauli evolution is drawn, the gate thus still shows the 
    information which gates are being evolved.
