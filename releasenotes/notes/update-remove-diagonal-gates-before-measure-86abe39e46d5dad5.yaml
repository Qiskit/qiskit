    The :class:`.RemoveDiagonalGatesBeforeMeasure` transpiler pass has been upgraded to
    include more diagonal gates: :class:`.PhaseGate`, :class:`.CPhaseGate`,
    :class:`.CSGate`, :class:`.CSdgGate` and :class:`.CCZGate`.
    In addition, the code of the :class:`.RemoveDiagonalGatesBeforeMeasure` was ported to Rust,
    and is now x20 faster for a 20 qubit circuit.
