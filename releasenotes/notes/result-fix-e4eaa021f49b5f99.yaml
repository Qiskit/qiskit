upgrade:
  - |
    :class:`.Result` was modified so that it always contains ``date``, ``status``,
    and ``header`` attributes (set to ``None`` if not specified). 
fixes:
  - |
    Fixed a bug in the string representation of :class:`.Result` objects that
    caused the attributes to be specified incorrectly.
