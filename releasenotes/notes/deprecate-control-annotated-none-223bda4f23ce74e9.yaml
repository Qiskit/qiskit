    Since Qiskit 1.0, the methods :meth:`.Gate.control` and :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.control`
    accept the argument ``annotated`` which can be either ``False``, ``True`` or ``None``.
    Presently, a controlled gate is represented using a dedicated controlled-gate class
    when it exists, regardless of the value of ``annotated``, for instance a two-controlled
    version of an  :class:`.XGate` is a :class:`.CCXGate`. If a dedicated controlled-gate
    class does not exist, the controlled gate is represented as a :class:`.ControlledGate`
    when ``annotated=False`` and as an :class:`.AnnotatedOperation` when ``annotated=True``.
    The default value ``annotated=None`` is treated exactly the same as ``False``. 
    
    In Qiskit 3.0, we will no longer allow setting ``annotated=None`` and instead change
    set the default to ``annotated=True``. This is recommended, as it defers the
    construction of the controlled circuit from the circuit construction to the transpiler,
    and enables additional controlled-gate optimizations, typically leading to higher-quality
    circuits (especially for hierarhical circuits).

    However, you will still be able to explicitly set ``annotated=False`` to preserve the
    previous behavior.
