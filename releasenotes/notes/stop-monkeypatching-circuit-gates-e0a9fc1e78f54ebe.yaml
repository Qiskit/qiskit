features:
  - |
    The quantum circuit gates are visible in IDE detection, since these
    methods are now defined in the circuit class itself.
deprecations:
  - |
    The `qiskit.extensions.standard` module is deprecated and the gates
    have been moved to `qiskit.circuit.library.standard_gates`.
