    Added two parameters to :class:`.GenericBackendV2` to exclude error (`noise_info`) and
    pulse channel information (`pulse_channels`) from the construction of the backend. These parameters
    are true by default, replicating the initial default behavior of the constructor. A memory-sensitive
    user may set these options to `False` to reduce the memory overhead by 40x when transpiling on large-
    scale :class:`.GenericBackendV2`.
