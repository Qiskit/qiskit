    Fixed an issue with :class:`~.FullAncillaAllocation` so it can now function with :class:`~.Target` objects that do not have a
    coupling map (typically because there are no 2 qubit gates in the :class:`~.Target`). In this case :class:`~.FullAncillaAllocation` will add
    ancilla qubits so that the number of qubits in the :class:`~.DAGCircuit` matches the number
    :attr:`.Target.num_qubits`.
