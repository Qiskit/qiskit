    Fixed the OpenQASM 2 output of :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.qasm` when a custom gate object contained
    a gate with the same name.  Ideally this shouldn't happen for most gates, but complex algorithmic
    operations like the :class:`.GroverOperator` class could produce such structures accidentally.
