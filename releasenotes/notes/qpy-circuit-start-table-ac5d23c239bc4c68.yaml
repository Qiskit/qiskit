    The QPY format has been upgraded to version 16, which includes a new circuit start table
    which contains the byte offsets of the start of each circuit in a QPY file. This allows
    for a potentially more efficient loading of circuits from QPY files, in a multi-threaded
    rust implementation in the future.
