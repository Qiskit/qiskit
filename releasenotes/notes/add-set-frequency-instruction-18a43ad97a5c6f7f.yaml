    Added a new feature. The :py:class:`~qiskit.pulse.instructions.SetFrequency` instruction allows users to change the
    frequency of the ``PulseChannel``. This is done in the following way

        sched += SetFrequency(5.5e9, DriveChannel(0))

    In this example, the frequency of all pulses before the ``SetFrequency`` command
    will be the default frequency and all pulses applied to drive channel zero after
    the ``SetFrequency`` command will be at 5.5 GHz. Users of ``SetFrequency`` should
    keep in mind any hardware limitations.
