fixes:
  - |
    Added missing ``repr`` support for :class:`~qiskit.circuit.Duration`.
  - |
    Added missing support for Python pickling of :class:`~qiskit.circuit.Duration`.
    This was preventing parallel transpilation of circuits with 
    :meth:`~.QuantumCircuit.delay` instructions that use duration
    expressions.
