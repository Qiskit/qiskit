    The ``ParametricPulse`` base class and pulse library were removed (previously located
    at ``qiskit.pulse.library.parametric_pulses``), following their deprecation on
    Qiskit 0.46.

    The ``ParametricPulse`` base class and pulse library were superseded by the
    :class:`~qiskit.pulse.SymbolicPulse` class and pulse library, which provide
    better performance and QPY support. All removed library pulses have a
    :class:`~qiskit.pulse.SymbolicPulse` counterpart, namely:

    * :class:`~qiskit.pulse.Constant`
    * :class:`~qiskit.pulse.Drag`
    * :class:`~qiskit.pulse.Gaussian`
    * :class:`~qiskit.pulse.GaussianSquare`
