    Fix a bug where a bound :class:`.ParameterExpression` was not identified as real 
    if ``symengine`` was installed and the bound expression was not a plain ``1j``.
    For example::
  
        from qiskit.circuit import Parameter

        x = Parameter("x")
        expr = 1j * x
        bound = expr.bind({x: 2})
        print(bound.is_real())  # used to be True, but is now False
