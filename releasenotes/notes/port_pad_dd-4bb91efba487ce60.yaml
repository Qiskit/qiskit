    The transpiler pass, :class:`.PadDynamicalDecoupling` has been ported to Rust for
    improved performance. This pass is responsible for inserting dynamical
    decoupling sequences into quantum circuits for error mitigation.
    The ported version maintains the same functionality and interface as the
    previous Python implementation, ensuring compatibility with existing
    workflows while benefiting from the performance enhancements of Rust.
