    The :class:`.SabreSwap` transpiler pass, used in :func:`.transpile` when
    ``routing_method="sabre"`` is set, will no longer sporadically drop
    classically conditioned gates and their successors from circuits during the
    routing phase of transpilation.  See
    `#8040 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/8040>`__.
