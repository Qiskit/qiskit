    Adds ``ScalarOp`` operator class that represents a scalar multiple of an
    identity operator. This can be used to initialize an identity on arbitrary
    dimension subsystems and it will be implicitly converted to other
    BaseOperator subclasses (such as an ``Operator`` or ``QuantumChannel``)
    when it is composed with, or added too, them.

    Example: Identity operator

    .. code-block::

        from qiskit.quantum_info import ScalarOp, Operator

        X = Operator.from_label('X')
        Z = Operator.from_label('Z')

        init = ScalarOp(2 ** 3)  # 3-qubit identity
        op = init @ X([0]) @ Z([1]) @ X([2])  # Op XZX
