    Introduced a new negation unary operation :meth:`~.expr.negate` allowing users to negate 
    float and duration expressions. In-case a scalar is passed, it is automatically lifted to 
    the correct type.

    Examlpe usage::

      from qiskit.circuit import ClassicalRegister
      from qiskit.circuit.classical import expr, types

      threshold = expr.Value(0.1, types.Float())
      some_measured_numerical_val = expr.cast(cr, types.Float()) # imagine a meaningful computation based off `cr` here
      res = qc.add_var("v", some_measured_numerical_val)

      with qc.if_test(expr.greater(res, threshold)) as else_:
          qc.rz(pi/3, 0)
      with else_:
          with qc.if_test(expr.greater(expr.negate(res), threshold)): # say res can be negative
        qc.rz(-pi/3, 0)
