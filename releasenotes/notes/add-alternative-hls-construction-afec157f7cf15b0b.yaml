    Added an alternative way to specify the synthesis methods used for a given
    high-level-object in :class:`.HighLevelSynthesis` transpiler pass. As before,
    a synthesis method can be specified as a tuple consisting of the name of the method
    and additional arguments. Additionally, a synthesis method can be specified as an
    instance of :class:`.HighLevelSynthesisPlugin`.
    The following example illustrates the new functionality::

        from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
        from qiskit.circuit.library.generalized_gates import PermutationGate
        from qiskit.transpiler import PassManager
        from qiskit.transpiler.passes.synthesis.high_level_synthesis import HLSConfig, HighLevelSynthesis
        from qiskit.transpiler.passes.synthesis.high_level_synthesis import ACGSynthesisPermutation

        qc = QuantumCircuit(6)
        qc.append(PermutationGate([1, 2, 3, 0]), [1, 2, 3, 4])

        hls_config = HLSConfig(permutation=[ACGSynthesisPermutation()])
        pm = PassManager(HighLevelSynthesis(hls_config=hls_config))
        qc_synthesized = pm.run(qc)
