    Add a ``control`` method to the ``QuantumCircuit`` to return a controlled
    version of the circuit, with both open and closed controls. 
    This functionality has previously only been accessible via the ``Gate``
    object. The underlying implementation of ``QuantumCircuit.control``
    relies on ``Gate.control``.
