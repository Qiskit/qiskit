    :meth:`.BlueprintCircuit.copy_empty_like` now returns an empty :class:`.QuantumCircuit` 
    with the same number of qubits/clbits and the same metadata as the original circuit, instead 
    of a :class:`.BlueprintCircuit`. This change is to mitigate unexpected behavior where dealing 
    with an "empty" copy of a blueprint circuit would re-build the circuit data.
    Note that :meth:`.BlueprintCircuit.copy` still returns a :class:`.BlueprintCircuit`.
