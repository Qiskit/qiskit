    Fixed a bug with :meth:`.BlueprintCircuit.copy_empty_like`, where the supposedly empty copy
    would rebuild the original circuit. The method now returns a plain :class:`.QuantumCircuit`
    instead of a :meth:`.BlueprintCircuit`, which guarantees that the output circuit is indeed empty.
    Fixed `#13535 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/13535>`__.
