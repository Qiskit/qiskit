fixes:
  - |
    :meth:`.DAGCircuit.apply_operation_back`, :meth:`~.DAGCircuit.apply_operation_back` and
    :func:`circuit_to_dag` will now add new edges in a deterministic order.  The previous behavior
    could cause certain transpiler passes (such as :class:`.SabreSwap`) to traverse the DAG in
    non-deterministic orders.
  - |
    :meth:`.DAGCircuit.apply_operation_front` can no longer insert invalid self loops when handling
    nodes that include classical conditions.
