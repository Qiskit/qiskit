upgrade:
  - |
    For the :class:`~DAGNode`, the previously deprecated ``type``, ``op``,
    ``qargs``, ``cargs``, and ``wire`` kwargs and attributes have been removed.
    These were originally deprecated in the 0.19.0 release. The ``op``,
    ``qargs``, and ``cargs`` kwargs and attributes can be accessed only on
    instances of :class:`~DAGOpNode`, and the ``wire`` kwarg and attribute are 
    only on instances of :class:`~DAGInNode` or :class:`~DAGOutNode`.
