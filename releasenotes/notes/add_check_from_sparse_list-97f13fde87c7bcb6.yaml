    Added a check process and a flag which is used to check if the qubit designated from input Pauli list is already assigned (not I)
    to :func:`from_sparse_list` in the :class:`SparsePauliOp`. The flag is used if check is to be run. The default value is True.
    See `#7916 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/7916>`__.
