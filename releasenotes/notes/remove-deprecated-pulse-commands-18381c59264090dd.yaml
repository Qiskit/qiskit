upgrade:
  - |
    The `qiskit.pulse.commands` module containing `Commands` was deprecated in
    Terra release 0.13.0 and have now been removed. You will have to upgrade
    your Pulse code if you were still using commands. For example::

        # old
        Command(args)(channel)

        # new
        Instruction(args, channel)

    ::

        Acquire(duration)(AcquireChannel(0)) -> Acquire(duration, AcquireChannel(0))
        Delay(duration)(channel) -> Delay(duration, channel)

        # FrameChange was also renamed
        FrameChange(angle)(DriveChannel(0)) -> ShiftPhase(angle, DriveChannel(0))

        # Pulses need to be `Play`d
        Gaussian(...)(DriveChannel(0)) -> Play(Gaussian(...), DriveChannel(0))
