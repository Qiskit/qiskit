    Port :func: `.synth_cz_depth_line_mr` to Rust. This function synthesizes a CZ circuit for linear nearest neighbour (LNN) connectivity, 
    based on Maslov and Roetteler. On a 350x350 binary matrix, the Rust implementation yields a speedup of about 30 times.

    Additionally, port :func: `.synth_permutation_reverse_lnn_kms` to Rust, which synthesizes a reverse permutation for linear nearest-neighbor architectures using
    Kutin, Moulton, Smithline method.
