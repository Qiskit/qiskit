    Nesting a :class:`.FlowController` inside another in a :class:`.PassManager`
    could previously cause some transpiler passes to become "forgotten" during
    transpilation, if the passes returned a new :class:`.DAGCircuit` rather than
    mutating their input.  Nested :class:`.FlowController`\ s will now affect
    the transpilation correctly.
