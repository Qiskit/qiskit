    The :py:class:`~qiskit.pulse.instructions.ShiftFrequency` instruction allows users
    to shift the frequency from the set frequency. For example::

       sched += ShiftFrequency(-340e6, DriveChannel(0))

    In this example, all the pulses applied to ``DriveChannel(0)`` after the
    ``ShiftFrequency`` command will have the envelope a frequency decremented by 340MHz.
