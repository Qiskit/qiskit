    Adds an argument ``limit_amplitude`` to the constructor of ParametricPulse
    class, and derived classes Gaussian, GaussianSquare, Drag and Constant, to
    enable or disable the amplitude limit of 1 on the pulse. Fixes #6544.  This
    option gets propagated to the parent class Pulse. With this option enabled,
    ParametricPulse class and its subclasses do not allow amplitudes larger
    than 1. By default, the value of ``limit_amplitude`` is true, so that the
    amplitude is constrained to be less than 1.
