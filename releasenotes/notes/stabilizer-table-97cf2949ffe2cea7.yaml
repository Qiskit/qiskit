    Adds :class:`qiskit.quantum_info.StabilizerTable`` class. This is a subclass
    of the :class:`qiskit.quantum_info.PauliTable` class which includes a boolean
    phase vector along with the Pauli table array. This represents a list of
    Stabilizer operators which are real-Pauli operators with +1 or -1 coefficient.
    Because the stabilizer matrices are real the ``"Y"`` label matrix is defined as
    ``[[0, 1], [-1, 0]]``. See the API documentation for additional information.
