    The internal API of the :class:`qiskit.opflow.OperatorBase` abstract class
    has been changed to use :class:`~qiskit.opflow.mixins.StarAlgebraMixin` ported from
    qiskit-nature and the newly added :class:`~qiskit.opflow.mixins.TensorMixin`.
    By using a common mixin, we can unify the API and simplify the implementation.
