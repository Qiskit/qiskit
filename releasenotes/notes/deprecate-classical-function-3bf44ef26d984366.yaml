    The :mod:`qiskit.circuit.classicalfunction` and with it
    the :class:`.ClassicalFunction`, its related :func:`.classical_function`
    and :class:`.BooleanExpression` have been deprecated as of Qiskit 1.4 
    and will be removed in Qiskit 2.0. This change is done to avoid a 
    dependency on the external library `tweedledum`, which is no longer 
    compatible with all of Qiskit's supported platforms and Python versions.
    For a similar functionality please use the :class:`.PhaseOracle` which
    is going to have a `tweedledum` independent implementation, and
    the :class:`.BitFlipOracle` which will be added in Qiskit 2.0.
