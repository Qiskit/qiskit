    The :mod:`qiskit.circuit.classicalfunction` and with it
    the :class:`.ClassicalFunction` and its related :func:`.classical_function`
    have been deprecated as of Qiskit 1.4 and will be removed in Qiskit 2.0.
    This change is done to avoid a dependency on the external library `tweedledum`,
    which is no longer compatible with all of Qiskit's supported platforms and 
    Python versions.
    For a similar functionality please use the :class:`.BooleanExpression` which
    is going to have a `tweedledum` independent implementation..
