    The :mod:`qiskit.circuit.classicalfunction` and with it
    the :class:`.ClassicalFunction`, its related :func:`.classical_function`
    and :class:`.BooleanExpression` have been deprecated as of Qiskit 1.4 
    and will be removed in Qiskit 2.0. This change is done to avoid a 
    dependency on the external library `tweedledum`, which is no longer 
    compatible with all of Qiskit's supported platforms and Python versions.
    For a similar functionality please use the :class:`.PhaseOracle` which
    is going to have a `tweedledum` independent implementation, and
    the :class:`.BitFlipOracle` which will be added in Qiskit 2.0.

    Until :class:`.BitFlipOracle` is added, a phase flip oracle can be converted
    to a bit flip oracle by conditioning it on the result qubit, and applying 
    Hadamard gate before and after the application of the oracle, as in the
    following example (where the oracle is on `qr_x` and the result is on `qr_y`):

    .. code-block:: python
    
        phase_flip_oracle = PhaseOracle(bool_expr)
        controlled_phase_flip_oracle = phase_flip_oracle.control(1)
        qc.h(qr_y)
        qc.compose(controlled_phase_flip_oracle, qubits=[*qr_y, *qr_x], inplace=True)
        qc.h(qr_y)
