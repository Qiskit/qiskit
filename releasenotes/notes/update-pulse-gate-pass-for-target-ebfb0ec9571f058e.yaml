features:
  - |
    A new method :meth:`.CalibrationEntry.get_duration` has been added to
    calibration entries. This method returns duration of calibration
    in units of dt when available, otherwise returns None.
upgrade:
  - |
    :meth:`.Target.update_from_instruction_schedule_map` no longer raises
    KeyError nor ValueError when qubits are missing in the target instruction
    or inst_name_map is not provided for undefined instruction.
    In the former case, it just ignores the inst map definition for undefined qubits.
    In the latter case, gate mapping is pulled from the standard Qiskit gates
    and finally custom :class:`.Gate` object is defined from the schedule name.
