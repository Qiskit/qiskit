    Update the synthesis of :class:`.CSGate` and :class:`.CSdgGate` in the equivalence library.
    Previously, the basis translator used 3 :class:`.CXGate` gates for the synthesis of
    :class:`.CSdgGate` and now it uses only two :class:`.CXGate`.
    For both gates we reduce the number of single-qubit gates in their basis translation.
