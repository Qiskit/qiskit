    The standard equivalence library has additional equivalences for :class:`.CSGate` and :class:`.CSdgGate`.
    When transpiling to the `["cx", "u"]` basis set, the :class:`.BasisTranslator` transpiler pass now uses
    2  :class:`.CXGate` gates instead of 3 for :class:`.CSdgGate`, and in addition reduces the number of single-qubit
    gates in both cases.
