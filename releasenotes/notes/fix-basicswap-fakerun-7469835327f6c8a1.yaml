    Fixed an issue in the the :class:`~.BasicSwap` class that
    prevented the :meth:`.BasicSwap.run` method from functioning if the
    ``fake_run`` keyword argument was set to ``True`` when the class was
    instantiated.
    Fixed `#10149 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/10147>`__
