fixes:
  - |
    Fixed an issue where trying to display registerless bits would cause
    a failure of the ``mpl`` and the ``latex`` circuit drawers. Also the
    display of registerless bits in the ``text`` drawer had an ``_`` in
    front of the number, which has been removed.
    Fixed `#6732 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/6732>`__

  - |
    For one-bit registers, all of the circuit drawers now display only
    the register name and no longer show the ``0`` subscript.
    Fixed `#5784 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/5784>`__
