    Fixed bad handling of ``__init_subclass__`` by :func:`~qiskit.utils.wrap_method`
    in Python 3.11. Previously, in Python 3.11, ``wrap_method`` would wrap the
    unbounded function of ``__init_subclass__`` and then fail when invoked
    because the bound class object was not passed to the function. Starting in
    Python 3.11.1, this issue affected :class:`~qiskit.test.QiskitTestCase`,
    preventing it from being imported by other test code. Fixed `#9291
    <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/9291>`__.
