    Fixed handling of some ``classmethod``\ s by
    :func:`~qiskit.utils.wrap_method` in Python 3.11. Previously, in Python
    3.11, ``wrap_method`` would wrap the unbound function associated with the
    ``classmethod`` and then fail when invoked because the class object usually
    bound to the ``classmethod`` was not passed to the function. Starting in
    Python 3.11.1, this issue affected :class:`~qiskit.test.QiskitTestCase`,
    preventing it from being imported by other test code. Fixed `#9291
    <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/9291>`__.
