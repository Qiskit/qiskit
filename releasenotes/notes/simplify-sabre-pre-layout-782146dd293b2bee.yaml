    Added a new argument ``min_distance`` to :class:`.SabrePreLayout` pass, that
    specifies the minimum distance to run the internal VF2 search with the
    augmented coupling map. This can be used to skip running the distance-1 check
    as this corresponds to simply running the ``VF2Layout`` pass.
