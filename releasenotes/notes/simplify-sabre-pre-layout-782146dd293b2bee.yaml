    Added a new argument ``min_distance`` to :class:`.SabrePreLayout` pass, that
    specifies the minimum distance to run the internal VF2 search with the
    augmented coupling map. This can be used to skip running the distance-1 check
    as this corresponds to simply running the ``VF2Layout`` pass.

    The :class:`.SabrePreLayout` pass is simplified to leverage
    improvements in the :class:`.VF2Layout` pass. The expensive post-processing
    step to minimize "extra" edges in the layout has been removed, as this
    optimization is now handled more efficiently by ``VF2Layout``'s internal
    scoring mechanism. As a result, the ``improve_layout`` argument is now
    obsolete and has no effect.
