    Added a new argument ``min_distance`` to the :class:`.SabrePreLayout` pass, that
    specifies the distance for the first VF2 run with the augmented coupling map.
    Setting ``min_distance > 1`` skips all smaller-distance checks, and in particular
    skips the distance-1 check which corresponds to running the ``VF2Layout`` pass.

    The :class:`.SabrePreLayout` pass is simplified to leverage
    improvements in the :class:`.VF2Layout` pass. The expensive post-processing
    step to minimize "extra" edges in the layout has been removed, as this
    optimization is now handled more efficiently by internal scoring mechanism
    of ``VF2Layout``. Consequently, the ``improve_layout`` argument is now
    obsolete and has no effect.
