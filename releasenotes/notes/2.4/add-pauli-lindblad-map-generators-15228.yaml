    Added the :meth:`.PauliLindbladMap.generators` method, which provides a more
    convenient accessor for the map's generator terms. This is an alias for the existing
    :meth:`.PauliLindbladMap.get_qubit_sparse_pauli_list_copy` method and aligns with
    the naming conventions used in Aer and Runtime for similar classes.
