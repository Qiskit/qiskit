    Fixed a bug where the default product formula synthesis for :class:`.PauliEvolutionGate`
    did not correctly handle all-identity terms in the operator. The all-identity term
    should introduce a global phase equal to ``-evolution_time``, but was off by a factor
    of 2 and could break for parameterized times.
    Fixed `#13625 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/13625>`__.
