    Fixed an issue with the :func:`~.qs_decomposition` function, which does
    quantum Shannon decomposition, when it was called on trivial numeric
    unitaries that do not benefit from this decomposition, an unexpected error
    was raised. This error has been fixed so that such unitaries are detected
    and the equivalent circuit is returned.
    Fixed `#10036 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/10036>`__
