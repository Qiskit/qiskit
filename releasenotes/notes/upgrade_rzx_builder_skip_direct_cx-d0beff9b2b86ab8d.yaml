upgrade:
  - |
    :class:`.RZXCalibrationBuilder` and :class:`.RZXCalibrationBuilderNoEcho`
    have been upgraded to skip stretching CX gates implemented by
    non-echoed cross resonance (ECR) sequence to avoid termination of the pass
    with unexpected errors.
    These passes take new argument ``verbose`` that controls warning.
    If ``verbose=True`` is set, pass raises user warning when it enconters
    non-ECR sequence.

  - |
    Unused argument ``qubit_channel_mapping`` in
    :class:`.RZXCalibrationBuilder` and :class:`.RZXCalibrationBuilderNoEcho`

    This argument is no longer used.
