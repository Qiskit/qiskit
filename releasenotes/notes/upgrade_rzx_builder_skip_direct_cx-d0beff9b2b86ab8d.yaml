upgrade:
  - |
    :class:`.RZXCalibrationBuilder` and :class:`.RZXCalibrationBuilderNoEcho`
    have been upgraded to skip stretching CX gates implemented by
    non-echoed cross resonance (ECR) sequence to avoid termination of the pass
    with unexpected errors.
    These passes take new argument ``verbose`` that controls warning.
    If ``verbose=True`` is set, pass raises user warning when it enconters
    non-ECR sequence.
deprecations:
  - |
    The unused argument ``qubit_channel_mapping`` in the
    :class:`.RZXCalibrationBuilder` and :class:`.RZXCalibrationBuilderNoEcho`
    transpiler passes have been deprecated and will be removed.
    This argument is no longer used.
other:
  - |
    The transpiler pass module :mod:`~qiskit.transpiler.passes.calibration` has been reorganized.
    :class:`.PulseGates` has been moved to :mod:`~qiskit.transpiler.passes.calibration.pulse_gates`,
    and :class:`.RZXCalibrationBuilder` and :class:`.RZXCalibrationBuilderNoEcho`
    have been moved to :mod:`~qiskit.transpiler.passes.calibration.rzx_builders`.
