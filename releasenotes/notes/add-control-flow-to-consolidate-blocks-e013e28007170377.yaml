    Enabled performing the :class:`qiskit.transpiler.passes.ConsolidateBlocks` pass inside the
    blocks of :class:`qiskit.circuit.ControlFlowOp`. This pass collects several sequences of gates
    and replaces each sequence with the equivalent numeric unitary gate. This new feature enables
    applying this pass recursively to the blocks in control flow operations. Note that the meaning
    of "block" in `:class:`qiskit.transpiler.passes.ConsolidateBlocks` is unrelated to that in
    :class:`qiskit.circuit.ControlFlowOp`.
