features:
  - |
    Support for ``rep_delay`` flag added when assembling/executing a ``qobj``. ``rep_delay``
    denotes the time between program executions. It will only be used if
    ``backend.configuration().dynamic_reprate_enabled``. In this case, its value must be within
    range defined by the backend as ``backend.configuration().rep_delay_range``. If the user does
    not supply a ``rep_delay`, the backend default
    ``backend.configuration().default_rep_delay`` will be used (assuming it exists). If dynamic rep
    rates are not enabled on the device, the qobj value of ``rep_delay`` will be ignored and
    ``rep_time`` (the total duration of the program) will be used instead.

    ``qobj`` schema has been updated to include ``rep_delay``.
    Backend configuration schema has been updated to include ``rep_delay_range`` and
    ``default_rep_delay``.
