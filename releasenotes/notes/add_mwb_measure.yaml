    Added a new function , :func:mwb_measure is an estimation of the quantum entanglement
     measure known as the Meyer-Wallach-Brennen measure. This measure calculates the average 
     subsystem linear entropy of the constituent qubits.

     The mathematical formula for this measure is, 
     $Q=2\left(1-\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n Tr(\rho_i^2)\right)$

     where :math:`\rho_i` is a density matrix obtained by tracing all the other
     subsystems except the ith subsystem and n is the total number of subsystems.
