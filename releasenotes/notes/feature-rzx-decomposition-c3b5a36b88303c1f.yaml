    This release introduces a decomposition method for two-qubit gates which
    targets user-defined sets of RZX gates.  Transpiler users can enable
    decomposition for {CX, RZX(pi/2), and RZX(pi/3)} specifically by including
    `'rzx'` in their `basis_gates` list.  Quantum information package users can
    find the method itself under the `MonodromyZXDecomposer` class.
