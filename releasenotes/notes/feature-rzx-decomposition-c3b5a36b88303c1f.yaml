    This release introduces a decomposition method for two-qubit gates which
    targets user-defined sets of RZX gates.  Transpiler users can enable
    decomposition for {RZX(pi/2), RZX(pi/4), and RZX(pi/6)} specifically by including
    `'rzx'` in their `basis_gates` list.  Quantum information package users can
    find the method itself under the `XXDecomposer` class.
