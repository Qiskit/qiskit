features:
  - |
    Added a new option ``max_num_qubits`` to :meth:`qiskit.circuit.CommutationChecker.commute`
    that specifies the maximum number of qubits to consider for the more expensive
    matrix multiplication-based commutativity check. This avoids trying to
    internally allocate arrays of size :math:`2^N \times 2^N`. Simpler versions of commutativity
    check (for instance, two quantum operations commute when they are over disjoint sets of qubits)
    continue to work without this limit.
fixes:
  - |
    The maximum number of qubits to consider for matrix multiplication-based commutativity check
    in :class:`~.CommutationChecker` is now limited to 3 by default.
    Fixed `#10488 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/10488>`__
