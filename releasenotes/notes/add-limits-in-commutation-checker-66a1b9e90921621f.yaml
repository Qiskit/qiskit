    The maximum number of qubits to consider for matrix multiplication-based commutativity check
    in :class:`~.CommutationChecker` is now limited to 3 by default. This avoids trying to
    internally allocate arrays of size :math:`2^N \times 2^N`. Simpler versions of commutativity
    check (for instance, two quantum operations commute when they are over disjoint sets of qubits)
    continue to work without this limit.
