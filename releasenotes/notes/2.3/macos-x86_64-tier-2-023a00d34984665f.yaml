    Support for macOS x86-64 (Intel) has been downgraded from tier 1 to tier 2.  Qiskit will
    still provide tested and pre-compiled wheels for this platform, but tests are only
    performed at the time of release, rather than at every change.  This might cause delays
    in releasing the wheels for this platform.

    This change was made because Apple have begun to sunset the platform, and the Qiskit team do not have
    the developer or CI resources left to continue tier 1 support.  We can only support macOS x86-64
    while GitHub continues to provide runners for it, and we expect `this support to be removed in the
    second half of 2027 <https://github.blog/changelog/2025-09-19-github-actions-macos-13-runner-image-is-closing-down/>`__.
