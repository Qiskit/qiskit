    The :class:`.OptimizeCliffordT` transpiler optimization pass has been
    significantly enhanced and reimplemented in Rust. 

    This pass performs a peephole optimization on circuits expressed
    using the Clifford+T gateset. More precisely, it collapses all chains
    of single-qubit gates containing Clifford+T into a minimal usage of :math:`T` (or :math:`T^\dagger`).
    The pass runs on a chain in time proportional to the number of gates in the chain.
