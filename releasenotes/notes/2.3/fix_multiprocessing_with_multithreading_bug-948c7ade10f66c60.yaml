    Fixed a potential deadlock issue when running layout passes such as :class:`.SabreLayout`
    with a disjoint connectivity in the :class:`.Target` and in a multiprocessing
    context from running :meth:`.PassManager.run` or :func:`.transpile` with more
    than one circuit. On Linux this is the default behavior when running :meth:`.PassManager.run`
    or :func:`.transpile` with more than one circuit, on all other platforms
    multiprocessing context has to be opted into. This was due to an underlying issue
    in CPython tracked in `python/cpython#84559 <https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/84559>`__
    when mixing multiprocessing and multithreading, typically Qiskit guards against mixing
    the two methods of parallelism but in the case of handling disjoint connectivity graphs this
    guard was missing around multithreaded rust code.
