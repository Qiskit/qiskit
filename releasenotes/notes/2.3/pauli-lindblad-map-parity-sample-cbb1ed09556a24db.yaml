    Added the :meth:`.PauliLindbladMap.parity_sample` method. This method is very similar to the
    pre-existing :meth:`.PauliLindbladMap.signed_sample` method, however it uses a sign convention
    that is more consistent with the rest of Qiskit, and therefore is the preferred method to use
    going forward. It has additional optional arguments to apply scalings to the rates when sampling
    without modifying the instance.
