    The method ``gate.control`` no longer returns an :class:`.AnnotatedOperation` when
    the argument ``annotated`` is set to ``True`` when a native controlled-gate class
    is available. This change is consistent with how the argument ``annotated``
    is used across the standard circuit library, and enables more efficient decompositions
    of control-annotated gates. The affected gates are:

    * Single-controlled ``H``, ``S``, ``Sdg``, ``U3``, ``Y``, ``Z``, ``SX``, ``RX``, ``RY``,
      ``RZ``, ``Swap`` and ``CZ`` gates;

    * Double-controlled ``Z``-gate;

    * arbitrarily-controlled ``Phase``, ``CPhase``, ``MCPhase``, ``U1``, ``CU1``, ``MCU1``
      and ``MCMT`` gates.

    The default value of the argument ``annotated`` in :meth:`QuantumCircuit.control` is now
    ``None`` instead of ``False``. This does not affect the actual circuits, but is consistent
    with the default value of ``annotated`` used across the circuit library.
