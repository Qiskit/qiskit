    Improved the performance of :meth:`.Clifford.dot` and of :meth:`.Clifford.compose`
    when called with ``front=True`` and a :class:`.QuantumCircuit` containing only Clifford gates.
    Previously, the circuit was completely consumed into a :class:`.Clifford` object first, and
    then the two objects were combined. Now, the base :class:`.Clifford` is updated iteratively,
    which is significantly faster for small circuits.
