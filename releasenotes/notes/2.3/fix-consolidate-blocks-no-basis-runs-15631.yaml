    Fixed :class:`.ConsolidateBlocks` so it consolidates multi-gate 2-qubit runs that contain
    no selected KAK basis gate when run without explicit ``basis_gates`` or ``target``.
    This improves early-stage merging for runs such as repeated 2-qubit ``unitary`` gates,
    allowing routing and later synthesis to work on shorter equivalent blocks.
