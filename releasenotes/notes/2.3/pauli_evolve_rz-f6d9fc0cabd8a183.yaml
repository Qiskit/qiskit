    :meth:`.Pauli.evolve` now correctly handles quantum circuits containing certain parametrized rotation gates,
    when the angle is a multiple of :math:`\pi/2`, e.g. ``RZGate(math.pi/2)`` or ``RZZGate(math.pi/2)``.
    Formerly they were not recognized as Clifford gates, and an error was raised.
