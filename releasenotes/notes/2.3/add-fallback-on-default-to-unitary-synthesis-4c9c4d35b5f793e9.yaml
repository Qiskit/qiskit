    Added a new option, ``fallback_on_default``, to the :class:`.UnitarySynthesis`
    transpiler pass. This option applies when the pass is called with a
    non-default synthesis plugin, specified via the argument ``method``.

    By default, the specified plugin is used to synthesize every unitary
    in the circuit (provided the plugin applies; for instance, it will not
    run if it does not support the number of qubits over which the unitary
    is defined). If the plugin cannot synthesize the unitary and returns
    ``None``, the original unitary is left unchanged in the circuit.
    When ``fallback_on_default`` is set to ``True``, the pass will instead
    invoke :class:`~.DefaultUnitarySynthesis` plugin when the specified
    method fails.
    
    This feature is particularly useful when custom plugins are intended to
    handle only a subset of all unitaries: users can rely on their custom
    logic when it applies and use the default synthesis where it does not.
