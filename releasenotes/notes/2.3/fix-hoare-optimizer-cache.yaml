    The `HoareOptimizer` no longer raises `ValueError: DAGOpNode(...) is not in list`
    when running with the default cache size on circuits that trigger multi-gate
    optimization. The pass now ignores stale cache entries during recursive
    optimization, ensuring circuits such as the one reported in
    `#14969 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/14969>`__ transpile without
    error.
