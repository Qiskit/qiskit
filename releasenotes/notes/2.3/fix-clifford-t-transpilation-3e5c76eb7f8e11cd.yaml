    The :class:`.HighLevelSynthesis` pass will now correctly select
    the optimization metric according to the basis set: two-qubit gate
    count for continuous bases and T count for Clifford+T bases.
    Previously, this information was not correctly propagated, resulting
    in worse than expected T counts.
