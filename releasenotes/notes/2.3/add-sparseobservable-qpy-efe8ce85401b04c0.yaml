    Fixed support for serializing :class:`.PauliEvolutionGate` with operators of type 
    :class:`.SparseObservable`, when using QPY version 17.
features_qpy:
  - |
    Version 17 of QPY now includes serialization formats for :class:`.SparseObservable`
    objects when used as parameters of objects.  In particular, this allows to
    serialize :class:`.PauliEvolutionGate` objects that internally use this
    operator and the payload of the evolution gate is updated.
upgrade_qpy:
  - |
    The default QPY version (:data:`.QPY_VERSION`) used in :func:`.qpy.dump` is now 17.
