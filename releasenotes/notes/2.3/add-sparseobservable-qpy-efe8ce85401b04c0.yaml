    Fixed support for serializing :class:`.PauliEvolutionGate` with operators of type 
    :class:`.SparseObservable` by adding QPY support for the latter.
    Fixes `#15070 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/15070>`__.
upgrade:
  - |
    QPY has been upgraded to version 17 to support :class:`.SparseObservable` serialization
    by introducing the ``SPARSE_OBSERVABLE`` format.
    In particular, this allows to serialize :class:`.PauliEvolutionGate` objects that internally 
    use this operator and the payload of the evolution gate is updated. 
    See :mod:`qiskit.qpy` for more details on the updated payloads.
