    The transpiler pass :class:`.LitinskiTransformation` has been extended to handle
    measurements. Thus, the transform now applies to a circuit containing Clifford,
    single-qubit RZ-rotation gates (including T and Tdg), and standard Z-measurements,
    and moves Clifford gates to the end of the circuit. In the process, it changes
    RZ-rotations to product Pauli rotations (implemented as :class:`.PauliEvolutionGate`
    gates), and changes Z-measurements to product Pauli measurements (implemented using
    :class:`.PauliProductMeasurement` instructions).
