    Added :func:`.gridsynth_rz`, which constructs a single-qubit quantum
    circuit approximating an RZ-rotation with a specified angle. The algorithm
    is described in the paper `Optimal ancilla-free Clifford+T approximation
    of z-rotations <https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.5555/3179330.3179331>`__ by Neil J. Ross, Peter Selinger and is implemented
    in https://github.com/qiskit-community/rsgridsynth.

    Added :func:`.gridsynth_unitary`, which constructs a single-qubit quantum
    circuit approximating a given single-qubit unitary matrix. The algorithm works
    by decomposing the unitary matrix into RZ-rotation, RX-rotation, and another
    RZ-rotation, and applying the Ross-Selinger algorithm to each of the
    three rotations.
features_transpiler:

    Added a new unitary synthesis plugin, :class:`.RossSelingerSynthesis`, which
    synthesizes single-qubit unitary gates using the Ross-Selinger algorithm
    and produces a single-qubit quantum circuit consisting of Clifford, :math:`T` and :math:`T^\dagger` gates.
    
    The plugin is invoked by the :class:`.UnitarySynthesis` transpiler pass
    when the parameter ``method`` is set to ``"gridsynth"``.
