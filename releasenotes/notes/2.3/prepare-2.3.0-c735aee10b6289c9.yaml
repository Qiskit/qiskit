  Qiskit 2.3.0 is a new feature release of the Qiskit SDK.

  This new version significantly expands the C API for transpilation, making more of the
  :class:`.Target` (:c:struct:`QkTarget`) available for inspection from C, and allowing the
  :class:`.DAGCircuit` (:c:struct:`QkDag`) to be created and manipulated.  This makes it possible
  to write custom transpiler passes when compiling against the stand-alone ``libqiskit`` object.
  There are individual transpilation-stage functions in the C API (e.g.
  :c:func:`qk_transpile_stage_layout`), to make it easier to insert custom logic into
  transpilation without having to recreate the entire pipeline manually.

  The performance and feature set of transpilation to early fault-tolerant targets has also been
  improved.  With the new :class:`.PauliProductMeasurement` instruction, which represents a
  projective measurement into a Pauli product basis, Qiskit now fully supports transpiling circuits 
  to a Pauli-based computation basis using the existing :class:`.LitinskiTransformation` pass.
  The new :class:`.RossSelingerSynthesis`, which can be set in the transpiler using 
  ``unitary_synthesis_method="gridsynth"``, enables using the asymptotically optimal Ross-Selinger 
  algorithm for single-qubit Clifford+T synthesis. Other improvements include, for example, a better
  :class:`.OptimizeCliffordT` pass or the :class:`.CommutativeOptimization` pass, which takes 
  into account commutative optimizations of Pauli-based circuits.

  Note that from this release onwards, Python 3.9 is no longer supported due to having passed its
  end of life in October 2025, and macOS on Intel processors has been downgraded to tier 2 platform
  support due to Apple beginning to sunset the platform.  All versions of CPython from 3.10 onwards
  are supported.  See `Operating system support <https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/docs/en/guides/install-qiskit#operating-system-support>`__
  for the current support tiers of different platforms.

  There will be further feature releases of Qiskit in the 2.x series; we do not expect to release
  Qiskit 3.0 until much later in 2026, as there is currently no need for breaking changes.
