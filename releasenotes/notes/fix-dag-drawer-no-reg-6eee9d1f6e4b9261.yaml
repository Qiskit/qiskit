    Fixed an issue with the visualization function :func:`~.dag_drawer` and
    method :meth:`.DAGCircuit.draw` where previously the drawer would fail
    when attempting to generate a visualization for a :class:`~.DAGCircuit`
    object that contained a :class:`~.Qubit` or :class:`~.Clbit` which wasn't
    part of a :class:`~QuantumRegister` or :class:`~ClassicalRegister`.
    Fixed `#7915 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/7915>`__.
