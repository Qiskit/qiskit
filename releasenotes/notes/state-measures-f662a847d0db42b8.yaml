features:
  - |
    Add state measure functions to the ``quantum_info`` module for ``entropy``,
    ``mutual_information``, ``concurrence``, and ``entanglement_of_formation``.
    These functions work with the ``Statevector`` and ``DensityMatrix`` classes.

deprecations:
  - |
    Deprecates everything in the legacy `tools.qi.qi.py` file, and
    `quantum_info.states.states.py` file. These legacy functions have all been
    superseded by functions and classes in the ``quantum_info`` module.
