    Added a new method :meth:`.SparsePauliOp.argsort`, which
    returns the composition of permutations in the order of sorting 
    by coefficient and sorting by Pauli. By using the `weight` kwarg 
    the output can additionally be sorted 
    by the number of non-identity terms in the Pauli, where the set of
    all Pauli's of a given weight are still ordered lexicographically.

    Added a new method :meth:`.SparsePauliOp.sort`.
    After sorting the coefficients using numpy's argsort, sort by Pauli.
    Pauli sort takes precedence. If Pauli is the same, it will be sorted 
    by coefficient. By using the `weight` kwarg the output can additionally 
    be sorted by the number of non-identity terms in the Pauli, where the 
    set ofall Pauli's of a given weight are still ordered lexicographically.
