    This is an update as part of QAMP's activities.
    PauliList has argsort() method and sort() method, 
    so we need these features in SparsePauliOp.

    Added a new argsort method.
    Returns the composition of permutations in the order of sorting 
    by coefficient and sorting by Pauli. By using the `weight` kwarg 
    the output can additionally be sorted 
    by the number of non-identity terms in the Pauli, where the set of
    all Pauli's of a given weight are still ordered lexicographically.

    Added a new sort method.
    After sorting the coefficients using numpy's argsort, sort by Pauli.
    Pauli sort takes precedence. If Pauli is the same, it will be sorted 
    by coefficient. By using the `weight` kwarg the output can additionally 
    be sorted by the number of non-identity terms in the Pauli, where the 
    set ofall Pauli's of a given weight are still ordered lexicographically.
