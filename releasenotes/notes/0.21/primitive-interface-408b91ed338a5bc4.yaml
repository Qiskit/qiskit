features:
  - |
    The primitives interface has been extended to accept objects in addition to indices
    as arguments to the ``__call__`` method.  The ``parameter_values`` argument can now be optional.
deprecations:
  - |
    The arguments' names when calling an :class:`~.primitives.Estimator` or
    :class:`~.primitives.Sampler` object as a function are renamed from
    ``circuit_indices`` and ``observable_indices`` to ``circuits`` and
    ``observables``.
