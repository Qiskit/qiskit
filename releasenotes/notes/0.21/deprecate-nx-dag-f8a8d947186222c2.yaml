deprecations:
  - |
    The `NetworkX <https://networkx.org/>`__  converter functions for the
    :meth:`.DAGCircuit.to_networkx` and
    :meth:`~.DAGCircuit.from_networkx`, along with the
    :meth:`.DAGDependency.to_networkx` method have been deprecated and will be
    removed in a future release. Qiskit has been using
    `retworkx <https://qiskit.org/documentation/retworkx/>`__ as its graph
    library since the qiskit-terra 0.12.0 release, and since then the networkx
    converter functions have been lossy. They were originally added so
    that users could leverage functionality in NetworkX's algorithms library
    not present in retworkx.  Since that time, retworkx has matured
    and offers more functionality, and the :class:`~.DAGCircuit` is tightly
    coupled to retworkx for its operation. Having these converter methods
    provides limited value moving forward and are therefore going to be
    removed in a future release.
