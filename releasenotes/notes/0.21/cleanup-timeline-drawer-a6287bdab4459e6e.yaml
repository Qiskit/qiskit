    A new attribute :attr:`.QuantumCircuit.op_start_times` 
    is populated when one of scheduling analysis passes is run on the circuit.
    It can be used to obtain circuit instruction with instruction time, for example::

      from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, transpile
      from qiskit.providers.fake_provider import FakeMontreal

      backend = FakeMontreal()

      qc = QuantumCircuit(2)
      qc.h(0)
      qc.cx(0, 1)

      qct = transpile(
          qc, backend, initial_layout=[0, 1], coupling_map=[[0, 1]], scheduling_method="alap"
      )
      scheduled_insts = list(zip(qct.op_start_times, qct.data))

fixes:
  - |
    The :func:`.timeline_drawer` visualization will no longer misalign classical
    register slots.
deprecations:
  - |
    Calling :func:`.timeline_drawer` with an unscheduled circuit has been deprecated.
    All circuits, even one consisting only of delay instructions,
    must be transpiled with the ``scheduling_method`` keyword argument of
    :func:`.transpile` set, to generate schedule information being stored in
    :attr:`.QuantumCircuit.op_start_times`.
