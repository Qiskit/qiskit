    The :class:`~.BackendV2`\ -based fake backends in
    the :mod:`qiskit.providers.fake_provider` module, such as
    :class:`.FakeMontrealV2`, now support the :class:`~qiskit.circuit.Delay` operation
    in their :attr:`~.BackendV2.target` attributes.  Previously, :class:`.QuantumCircuit` objects
    that contained delays could not be compiled to these backends.
