upgrade:
  - |
    The deprecated function :func:`.pauli_group` has been removed.
    It was originally deprecated in Qiskit Terra 0.17.
  - |
    Several deprecated methods on :class:`.Pauli` have been removed, which were
    originally deprecated in Qiskit Terra 0.17.  These were:

    ``sgn_prod``
      Use :meth:`.Pauli.compose` or :meth:`.Pauli.dot` instead.

    ``to_spmatrix``
      Use :meth:`.Pauli.to_matrix` with argument ``sparse=True`` instead.

    ``kron``
      Use :meth:`.Pauli.expand`, but beware that this returns a new object, rather
      than mutating the existing one.

    ``update_z`` and ``update_x``
      Set the ``z`` and ``x`` attributes of the object directly.

    ``insert_paulis``
      Use :meth:`.Pauli.insert`.

    ``append_paulis``
      Use :meth:`.Pauli.expand`.

    ``delete_qubits``
      Use :meth:`.Pauli.delete`.

    ``pauli_single``
      Construct the label manually and pass directly to the initializer, such as::

        Pauli("I" * index + pauli_label + "I" * (num_qubits - index - len(pauli_label)))

    ``random``
      Use :func:`.quantum_info.random_pauli` instead.
deprecations:
  - |
    The arguments ``x``, ``z`` and ``label`` to the initializer of
    :class:`.Pauli` were documented as deprecated in Qiskit Terra 0.17, but a bug
    prevented the expected warning from being shown at runtime.  The warning will
    now correctly show, and the arguments will be removed in Qiskit Terra 0.23 or
    later.  A pair of ``x`` and ``z`` should be passed positionally as a single
    tuple (``Pauli((z, x))``).  A string ``label`` should be passed positionally
    in the first argument (``Pauli("XYZ")``).
