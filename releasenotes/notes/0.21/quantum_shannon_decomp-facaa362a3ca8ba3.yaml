    Added a new module ``qiskit.quantum_info.synthesis.qsd`` to apply Quantum
    Shannon Decomposition of arbitrary unitaries. This functionality replaces
    the previous isometry-based approach in the default unitary synthesis
    transpiler pass as well as when adding unitaries to a circuit using a
    :class:`.UnitaryGate`.

    The Quantum Shannon Decomposition uses about half the cnot gates as the
    isometry implementation when decomposing unitary matrices of greater than
    two qubits.
