  The Qiskit 0.21.0 release highlights are:

   * Support for serialization of a pulse :class:`~.ScheduleBlock` via
     :mod:`qiskit.qpy`. The :ref:`qpy_format` has been updated to version 5
     which includes a definition for including the pulse schedules.
     To support this, a new :class:`~.SymbolicPulse` class was introduced to
     enable defining parametric pulse waveforms via symbolic expressions.
   * Improvements to working with preset pass managers. A new function
     :func:`~.generate_preset_pass_manager` enables easily generating
     a pass manager equivalent to what :func:`~.transpile` will use internally.
     Additionally, preset pass managers are now instances of
     :class:`~.StagedPassManager` which makes it easier to modify sections.
   * A refactor of the internal data structure of the
     :attr:`.QuantumCircuit.data` attribute. It previously was a list of
     tuples in the form ``(instruction, qubits, clbits)`` and now is a list of
     :class:`~.CircuitInstruction` objects. The :class:`~.CircuitInstruction`
     objects is backwards compatible with the previous tuple based access,
     however with runtime overhead cost.

  Additionally, the transpiler has been improved to enable better quality
  outputs. This includes the introduction of new passes such as
  :class:`~.VF2PostLayout` and :class:`~.ToqmSwap`.
