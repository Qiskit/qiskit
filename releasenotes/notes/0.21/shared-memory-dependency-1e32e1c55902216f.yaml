    For Python 3.7 `shared-memory38 <https://pypi.org/project/shared-memory38/>`__
    is now a dependency. This was added as a dependency for Python 3.7 to enable
    leveraging the shared memory constructs in the standard library of newer
    versions of Python. If you're running on Python >= 3.8 there is no extra
    dependency required.
fixes:
  - |
    Fixed an issue with :func:`~.transpile` where in some cases providing a
    list of basis gate strings with the ``basis_gates`` keyword argument or
    implicitly via a :class:`~.Target` input via the ``target`` keyword
    argument would not be interpreted correctly and result in a subset of the
    listed gates being used for each circuit.
  - |
    Fixed an issue in the :class:`~.UnitarySynthesis` transpiler pass which
    would result in an error when a :class:`~.Target` that didn't have any
    qubit restrictions on the operations (e.g. in the case of an ideal
    simulator target) was specified with the ``target`` keyword argument for the
    constructor.
