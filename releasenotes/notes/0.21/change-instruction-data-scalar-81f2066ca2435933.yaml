    The data type of each element in :attr:`.QuantumCircuit.data` has changed.
    It used to be a simple 3-tuple of an :class:`~.circuit.Instruction`, a list
    of :class:`.Qubit`\ s, and a list of :class:`.Clbit`\ s, whereas it is now
    an instance of :class:`.CircuitInstruction`.

    The attributes of this new class are :attr:`~.CircuitInstruction.operation`,
    :attr:`~.CircuitInstruction.qubits` and :attr:`~.CircuitInstruction.clbits`,
    corresponding to the elements of the previous tuple.  However,
    :attr:`~.CircuitInstruction.qubits` and :attr:`~.CircuitInstruction.clbits`
    are now ``tuple`` instances, not ``list``\ s.

    This new class will behave exactly like the old 3-tuple if one attempts to
    access its index its elements, or iterate through it.  This includes casting
    the :attr:`~.CircuitInstruction.qubits` and :attr:`~.CircuitInstruction.clbits`
    elements to lists.  This is to assist backwards compatibility.  Starting from
    Qiskit Terra 0.21, this is no longer the preferred way to access these elements.
    Instead, you should use the attribute-access form described above.

    This has been done to allow further developments of the :class:`.QuantumCircuit`
    data structure in Terra, without constantly breaking backwards compatibility.
    Planned developments include dynamic parameterized circuits, and an overall
    reduction in memory usage of deep circuits.
