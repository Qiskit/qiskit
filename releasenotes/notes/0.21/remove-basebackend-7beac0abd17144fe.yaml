upgrade:
  - |
    The previously deprecated ``BaseBackend``, ``BaseJob``, and ``BaseProvider``
    classes have all been removed. They were originally deprecated in the
    0.18.0 release. Instead of these classes you should be using the versioned
    providers interface classes, the latest being :class:`~.BackendV2`,
    :class:`~.JobV1`, and :class:`~.ProviderV1`.
  - |
    The previously deprecated ``backend`` argument for the constructor of the
    :class:`~.RZXCalibrationBuilder` transpiler pass has been removed. It was
    originally deprecated in the 0.19.0 release. Instead you should query
    the :class:`~.Backend` object for the ``instruction_schedule_map`` and
    ``qubit_channel_mapping`` and pass that directly to the constructor. For
    example, with a :class:`~.BackendV1` backend::

        from qiskit.transpiler.passes import RZXCalibrationBuilder
        from qiskit.providers.fake_provider import FakeMumbai

        backend = FakeMumbai()
        inst_map = backend.defaults().instruction_schedule_map
        channel_map = backend.configuration().qubit_channel_mapping
        cal_pass = RZXCalibrationBuilder(
            instruction_schedule_map=inst_map,
            qubit_channel_mapping=channel_map,
        )

    or with a :class:`~.BackendV2` backend::

        from qiskit.transpiler.passes import RZXCalibrationBuilder
        from qiskit.providers.fake_provider import FakeMumbaiV2

        backend = FakeMumbaiV2()
        inst_map = backend.instruction_schedule_map
        channel_map = {bit: backend.drive_channel(bit) for bit in range(backend.num_qubits)}
        cal_pass = RZXCalibrationBuilder(
            instruction_schedule_map=inst_map,
            qubit_channel_mapping=channel_map,
        )

deprecations:
  - |
    The ``qobj_id`` and ``qobj_header`` keyword arguments for the
    :func:`~.execute` function have been deprecated and will be removed in a
    future release. Since the removal of the ``BaseBackend`` class these
    arguments don't have any effect as no backend supports execution with a
    :class:`~.Qobj` object directly and instead only work with
    :class:`~.QuantumCircuit` objects directly.
