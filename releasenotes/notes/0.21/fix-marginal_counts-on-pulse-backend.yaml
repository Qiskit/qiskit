    The method :meth:`qiskit.result.marginal_counts`, when passed a :class:`.Result` from a
    pulse backend, would fail, because it contains an array of
    :class:`.ExperimentResult` objects, each of which have an :class:`QobjExperimentHeader`, and those
    :class:`ExperimentHeaders` lack `creg_sizes` instance-variables.  If the :class:`Result` came
    from a simulator backend (e.g. Aer), that instance-variable would be there.
    We fix :class:`marginal_counts` so that it skips logic that needs `creg_sizes` if the
    field is not present, or non-None.
