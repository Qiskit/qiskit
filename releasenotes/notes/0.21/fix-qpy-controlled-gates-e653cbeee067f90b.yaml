upgrade:
  - |
    The QPY version format version emitted by :func:`.qpy.dump` has been
    increased to version 5. This new format version is incompatible with the
    previous versions and will result in an error when trying to load it with
    a deserializer that isn't able to handle QPY version 5. This change was
    necessary to fix support for representing controlled gates properly and
    representing non-default control states.
fixes:
  - |
    Fixed support for QPY serialization (:func:`.qpy.dump`) and deserialization
    (:func:`.qpy.load`) of a :class:`~.QuantumCircuit` object containing custom
    :class:`~.ControlledGate` objects. Previously, an exception would be raised
    by :func:`.qpy.load` when trying to reconstruct the custom
    :class:`~.ControlledGate`.
    Fixed `#7999 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/7999>`__.

    Fixed support for QPY serialization (:func:`.qpy.dump`) and deserialization
    (:func:`.qpy.load`) of a :class:`~.QuantumCircuit` object containing custom
    :class:`~.MCPhaseGate` objects. Previously, an exception would be raised
    by :func:`.qpy.load` when trying to reconstruct the :class:`~.MCPhaseGate`.
  - |
    Fixed support for QPY serialization (:func:`.qpy.dump`) and deserialization
    (:func:`.qpy.load`) of a :class:`~.QuantumCircuit` object containing
    controlled gates with an open control state. Previously, the open control
    state would be lost by the serialization process and the reconstructed
    circuit.
