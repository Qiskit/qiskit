    Added a new pulse base class :class:`.SymbolicPulse`. This is a
    replacement of the conventional :class:`.ParametricPulse`, which will be deprecated.
    In the new base class, pulse-envelope and parameter-validation functions are
    represented by symbolic-expression objects.
    The new class provides self-contained and portable pulse data since these symbolic equations
    can be easily serialized through symbolic computation libraries.
upgrade:
  - |
    The pulse classes in :mod:`qiskit.pulse.library` are now subclasses of
    :class:`.SymbolicPulse` rather than :class:`.ParametricPulse`.  The available
    classes remain unchanged as
    :class:`~qiskit.pulse.library.Gaussian`,
    :class:`~qiskit.pulse.library.GaussianSquare`,
    :class:`~qiskit.pulse.library.Drag`, and
    :class:`~qiskit.pulse.library.Constant`.
    :class:`.SymbolicPulse` has full backward compatibility, and there should be
    no loss of functionality.
