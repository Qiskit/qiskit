    Added a new function :func:`~.marginal_memory` which is used to marginalize
    shot memory arrays. Provided with the shot memory array and the indices
    of interest, the function will return a marginalized shot memory array. This
    function differs from the memory support in the :func:`~.marginal_counts`
    method which only works on the ``memory`` field in a :class:`~.Results`
    object.
