features_circuits:
  - :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.compose` can be up to approximately two times faster when composing
    very long circuits onto another.
fixes:
  - Fixed a runtime cost linear in the number of bits of the base circuit in :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.compose`.
    This could cause performance problems when repeatedly composing small circuits with no clbits onto a base
    with a very large number of clbits.
