    Added the :class:`StarPreRouting` pass to the default optimization level 2+3 passmanager. `StarPreRouting`
    runs before a layout is fixed (i.e. on abstract circuits) and transforms a circuit with inner
    'star'-connectivities to a linear connectivity before continuing to other transpilation stages, e.g.
    the layouting and routing stage.
