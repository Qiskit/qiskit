    Added an optimizer :class:`.Fraxis` following the paper
    `arXiv:2104.14875 <https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.14875>`__.
    Fraxis is a generalized version of :class:`.NFT` and rotosolve/rotoselct.
    Fraxis can optimize only circuits with :class:`.UGate` as parameterized gates.
    See `#9528 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/9528>`__
    for the comparison with other optimizers.
upgrade:
  - |
    Extended :class:`.TwoLocal` to allow :class:`.UGate` as ``rotation_blocks``.
