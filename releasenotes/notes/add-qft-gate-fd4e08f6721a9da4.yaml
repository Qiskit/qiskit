    Added a new class :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.QFTGate` for
    natively representing Quantum Fourier Transforms (QFTs). The older way
    of representing QFTs via quantum circuits, see
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.QFT`, remains for backward compatibility.
    The new way of representing a QFT via a gate avoids synthesizing its
    definition circuit when the gate is declared, delaying the actual synthesis to
    the transpiler. It also allows to easily choose between several different
    algorithms for synthesizing QFTs, which are available as high-level-synthesis
    plugins.

    Added a synthesis method :func:`.synth_qft_full` for constructing a QFT circuit
    assuming a fully-connected architecture.

    Added two high-level-synthesis plugins for synthesizing a
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.QFTGate`.
    The class :class:`.QFTSynthesisFull` is based on :func:`.synth_qft_full` and synthesizes
    a QFT gate assuming all-to-all connectivity.
    The class :class:`.QFTSynthesisLine` is based on :func:`.synth_qft_line` and synthesizes
    a QFT gate assuming linear nearest neighbor connectivity.
