    The :class:`.ConsolidateGates` pass will now run the equivalent of the
    :class:`.Collect2qBlocks` pass internally if it was not run in a pass
    manager prior to the pass. Previously it was required that
    :class:`.Collect2qBlocks` or :class:`.Collect1qRuns` were run prior to
    :class:`.ConsolidateBlocks` for :class:`.ConsolidateBlocks` to do
    anything. By doing the collection internally the overhead of the pass
    is reduced. If :class:`.Collect2qBlocks` or :class:`.Collect1qRuns` are
    run prior to :class:`.ConsolidateBlocks` the collected runs by those
    passes from the property set are used and there is no change in behavior
    for the pass.
