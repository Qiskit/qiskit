    The :class:`.ConsolidateGates` pass will now run the the equivalent of the
    :class:`.Collect2qBlocks` pass internally if it was not run in a pass
    manager prior to the pass. Previously it was required that
    :class:`.Collect2qBlocks` or :class:`.Collect1qRuns` were run prior to
    :class:`.ConsolidateBlocks` for :class:`.ConsolidateBlocks` to do
    anything. By doing the collection internally the overhead of the pass
    is reduced. If :class:`.Collect2qBlocks` or :class:`.Collect1qRuns` are
    run prior to :class:`.ConsolidateBlocks` the collected runs by those
    passes from the property set are used and there is no change in behavior
    for the pass.

    Fixed an issue with the :class:`.ConsolidateBlocks` pass when it was
    processing single qubit runs. Previously if a single qubit run found by
    the :class:`.Collect1qRuns` pass consisteted of a single gate, the
    substitution of that gate would occur if the gate was in the target if
    it was specified. The intent of the logic was to substitute only if the
    gate was outside of the target. This has been corrected so the behavior
    is restored.
