    The ``PulseGates``, ``ValidatePulseGates``, ``RXCalibrationBuilder``, ``RZXCalibrationBuilder``,
    ``RZXCalibrationBuilderNoEcho`` and ``EchoRZXWeylDecomposition`` passes have been removed,
    following their deprecation in Qiskit 1.3. These passes depend on and relate to the Pulse
    package which is also being removed in Qiskit 2.0.
