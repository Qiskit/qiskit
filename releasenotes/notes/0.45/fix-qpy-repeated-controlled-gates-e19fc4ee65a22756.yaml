    Fixed a bug in QPY serialization (:mod:`qiskit.qpy`) where if a circuit contained
    multiple instances of parametrized controlled gates of the same class (not custom),
    the parameter values from the first instance were used to build the gate definitions
    of subsequent instances. The gates were rendered correctly despite this bug because
    the correct parameter values were stored, but not used to build the gates. Fixed
    `#10735 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/10735>`__.
