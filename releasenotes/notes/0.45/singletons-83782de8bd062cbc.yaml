    Introduced two new classes, :class:`.SingletonInstruction` and :class:`~.SingletonGate`, which
    are subclasses of :class:`~.circuit.Instruction` and :class:`~.Gate` respectively, that use a
    single instance for all objects of that type.
    The intent behind this class is to minimize the memory and construction
    overhead of using multiple gates in a circuit with the tradeoff of having
    global shared state. For this reason this class is only applicable to
    gates that do not have any unique and/or mutable state stored in an instance.
    For example, the best example of this is :class:`.XGate` doesn't contain
    any state and could leverage :class:`~.SingletonGate` (and does starting in
    this release), while :class:`~.RXGate` stores an angle parameter in an instance
    and thus can not use :class:`~.SingletonGate` because a single shared global
    instance can not represent the parameter values.

    The other potential issue to be aware of when using this class is around the
    use of the singleton classes is that the :class:`~.circuit.Instruction`
    data model supports some mutable state. Specifically, the
    :attr:`~.Instruction.label`, :attr:`~.Instruction.duration`, :attr:`~.Instruction.unit`, and
    :attr:`~.Instruction.condition` attributes are all accessible and mutable in the
    :class:`~.circuit.Instruction` and its direct subclasses. However, this is incompatible
    with having a shared object via :class:`~.SingletonInstruction`. For instances of
    :class:`~.SingletonInstruction`, setting these attributes directly is not allowed
    and it will raise an exception. If they are needed for a particular
    instance you must ensure you have a mutable instance using :meth:`.Instruction.to_mutable`
    (or use :meth:`.Instruction.c_if` for :attr:`~.Instruction.condition`), or
    ``label``, ``duration`` and ``unit`` can be given as keyword arguments during class construction.

    The following standard library gates are now instances of
    :class:`~.SingletonGate`:

     * :class:`~.DCXGate`
     * :class:`~.ECRGate`
     * :class:`~.HGate`
     * :class:`~.IGate`
     * :class:`~.iSwapGate`
     * :class:`~.SGate`
     * :class:`~.SdgGate`
     * :class:`~.SwapGate`
     * :class:`~.SXGate`
     * :class:`~.SXdgGate`
     * :class:`~.TGate`
     * :class:`~.TdgGate`
     * :class:`~.XGate`
     * :class:`~.RCCXGate`
     * :class:`~.RC3XGate`
     * :class:`~.YGate`
     * :class:`~.ZGate`

    This means that if these classes are instantiated as (e.g.) ``XGate()`` using
    all the constructor defaults, they will all share a single global
    instance. This results in large reduction in the memory overhead for > 1
    object of these types and significantly faster object construction time.

    Introduced a new class :class:`~.SingletonControlledGate` which is a subclass of
    :class:`~.ControlledGate` that uses a single instance for all objects of that type.
    The intent behind this class is to minimize the memory and construction
    overhead of using multiple gates in a circuit with the tradeoff of having
    global shared state. For this reason this class is only applicable to
    gates that do not have any unique and/or mutable state stored in an instance.
    For example, a :class:`.CXGate` doesn't contain any state and thus can
    leverage :class:`~.SingletonControlledGate` (and does starting in
    this release). In contrast, :class:`~.CRXGate` stores an angle parameter as
    part of its instance data and thus can not use :class:`~.SingletonControlledGate`.

    The other potential issue to be aware of when using
    :class:`~.SingletonControlledGate` is that the original data model
    of :class:`~.ControlledGate` supports mutation. Specifically, the
    :attr:`~.ControlledGate.label`, :attr:`~.ControlledGate.duration`,
    :attr:`~.ControlledGate.unit`, :attr:`~.ControlledGate.condition`, and
    :attr:`~.ControlledGate.ctrl_state` attributes are all accessible and mutable in the
    :class:`~.ControlledGate`, but mutation of these attributes on :class:`~.SingletonControlledGate` subclasses
    is not allowed, and will raise an exception. These attributes can be customized but only at creation time
    (i.e. via the constructor). In that case, the newly constructed gate will be a separate instance with the
    custom state instead of the globally shared instance. You can also use the
    :meth:`.SingletonControlledGate.to_mutable` method to get a mutable copy of a gate object and then mutate
    the attributes like you would on any other :class:`~.circuit.Instruction` object.

    The following standard library gates are now instances of
    :class:`~.SingletonControlledGate`:

     * :class:`~.CHGate`
     * :class:`~.CSGate`
     * :class:`~.CSdgGate`
     * :class:`~.CSwapGate`
     * :class:`~.CSXGate`
     * :class:`~.CXGate`
     * :class:`~.CCXGate`
     * :class:`~.C3SXGate`
     * :class:`~.C3XGate`
     * :class:`~.C4XGate`
     * :class:`~.CYGate`
     * :class:`~.CZGate`

    This means that unless a ``label``, ``condition``, ``duration``, ``unit``, or
    ``ctrl_state`` are set on the instance at creation time they will all share a
    single global instance whenever a new gate object is created. This results in large
    reduction in the memory overhead for > 1 object of these types.

    Added a new method :meth:`.Instruction.to_mutable` and attribute
    :attr:`.Instruction.mutable` which is used to get a mutable copy and check whether
    an :class:`~.circuit.Instruction` object is mutable. With the introduction
    of :class:`~.SingletonGate` these methods can be used to have a unified interface
    to deal with the mutability of instruction objects.
  - |
    Added an attribute :attr:`.Instruction.base_class`, which gets the "base" type of an
    instruction.  Many instructions will satisfy ``type(obj) == obj.base_class``, however the
    singleton instances of :class:`.SingletonInstruction` and :class:`.SingletonGate` are subclasses
    of their base type.  You can use the new :attr:`~.Instruction.base_class` attribute to find the
    base class of these.  See the attribute documentation for considerations on when other
    subclasses may modify their :attr:`~.Instruction.base_class`, and what this means for execution.

    The following standard library gates:

        * :class:`~.DCXGate`
        * :class:`~.ECRGate`
        * :class:`~.HGate`
        * :class:`~.IGate`
        * :class:`~.iSwapGate`
        * :class:`~.SGate`
        * :class:`~.SdgGate`
        * :class:`~.SwapGate`
        * :class:`~.SXGate`
        * :class:`~.SXdgGate`
        * :class:`~.TGate`
        * :class:`~.TdgGate`
        * :class:`~.XGate`
        * :class:`~.RCCXGate`
        * :class:`~.RC3XGate`
        * :class:`~.YGate`
        * :class:`~.ZGate`
        * :class:`~.CHGate`
        * :class:`~.CSGate`
        * :class:`~.CSdgGate`
        * :class:`~.CSwapGate`
        * :class:`~.CSXGate`
        * :class:`~.CXGate`
        * :class:`~.CCXGate`
        * :class:`~.C3SXGate`
        * :class:`~.C3XGate`
        * :class:`~.C4XGate`
        * :class:`~.CYGate`
        * :class:`~.CZGate`


    no longer are able to set :attr:`~.Gate.label`, :attr:`~.Gate.condition`,
    :attr:`~.Gate.duration`, or :attr:`~.Gate.unit` (and :attr:`~.ControlledGate.ctrl_state`
    for :class:`~.ControlledGate` subclasses) after instantiating an object
    anymore. :attr:`~.Gate.condition` can be set through
    the use :meth:`~.Gate.c_if`. You can use :meth:`~.Gate.to_mutable`
    to get a mutable copy of the instruction and then use the setter on that copy
    instead of the original object.  ``label``, ``duration`` and ``unit`` can
    be given as keyword arguments to these gates at construction time, and a
    mutable instance will be returned automatically.
    This change was necessary as part of converting
    these classes to be :class:`~.SingletonGate` and :class:`~.SingletonControlledGate`
    types which greatly reduces the memory footprint of repeated instances of these gates.

    For anything that interacts with :class:`~.Gate`, :class:`~.Operation`,
    or :class:`~.circuit.Instruction` objects or works with these as part of a
    :class:`~.QuantumCircuit` or :class:`~.DAGCircuit` classes it is important
    to note that the use of shared references for instances is much more common
    now. Previously, it was possible to reuse and share an instance of a
    circuit operation it wasn't very commonly used and a copy would generate
    a unique instance. This has changed starting in this release because of
    :class:`~.SingletonInstruction` and :class:`.SingletonGate` being made available (and a large
    number of standard library gates now built off of it). If your usage of these objects is
    assuming
    unique instances for every circuit operation there are potential issue because
    of shared state that will be reused between operations of the same type (that
    will persist through copy and deep copies). You can rely on the
    :attr:`.Instruction.mutable` attribute to check the mutability of an object or
    use :meth:`.Instruction.to_mutable` to get a mutable copy of any instruction.
  - |
    More :class:`~.circuit.Instruction` instances (those that return singletons) no longer
    strictly satisfy (for example)::

        type(XGate()) is XGate

    The returned object will, however, still be a standard subclass so :func:`isinstance` (the
    correct way to do type checking) will continue to work correctly.  Several instructions already
    had this property (e.g. :class:`.MCXGate`), but it is now more common as many more standard
    gates will do this.

    If you require the "base" type of a gate for some reason, omitting the synthetic singleton
    subclasses, which cannot be instantiated, see :attr:`.Instruction.base_class`.
fixes:
  - |
    Fixed an oversight in the :class:`~.ECRGate` that prevented setting an
    :attr:`.ECRGate.label` attribute at object construction time. All other
    :class:`~.Gate` classes and subclasses enable setting a ``label`` keyword
    argument in the constructor.
  - |
    Fixed an oversight in the :class:`~.Gate` (and standard-library subclasses) constructor
    where the :attr:`~.Gate.duration` and :attr:`~.Gate.unit` attributes could not
    be set as keyword arguments during construction. The parent class
    :class:`~.circuit.Instruction` supported setting this but :class:`~.Gate` was
    previously not exposing this interface correctly.
