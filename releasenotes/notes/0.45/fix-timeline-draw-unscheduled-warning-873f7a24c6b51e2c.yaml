deprecations:

    Passing a circuit to :func:`qiskit.visualization.timeline_drawer` that does not have scheduled
    node start-time information is deprecated.  Only circuits that have gone through one of the
    scheduling analysis passes (for example :class:`.ALAPScheduleAnalysis` or
    :class:`.ASAPScheduleAnalysis`) can be visualized.  If you have used one of the old-style
    scheduling passes (for example :class:`.ALAPSchedule` or :class:`.ASAPSchedule`), you can
    propagate the scheduling information by running::

      from qiskit import transpile
      from qiskit.transpiler import InstructionDurations

      scheduled = transpile(
        my_old_style_circuit,
        optimization_level=0,
        scheduling_method="alap",
        instruction_durations=InstructionDurations(),
      )

    This behavior was previously intended to be deprecated in Qiskit 0.37, but due to a bug in the
    warning, it was not displayed to users until now.  The behavior will be removed in Qiskit 1.0.
