    Added a new keyword argument, ``min_qubits``, to the constructor of the
    :class:`.BasisTranslator` transpiler pass. When set to a non-zero value this
    is used to set a minimum number of qubits to filter operations to translate
    in the circuit. For example, if ``min_qubits=3`` is set the
    :class:`.BasisTranslator` instance will only translate gates in the circuit
    that operate on 3 or more qubits.
