    The visualizations from the :func:`~.plot_gate_map`,  :func:`~.plot_coupling_map`.
    :func:`~.plot_error_map`,  and :func:`~.plot_circuit_layout` functions have been significantly
    improved for rendering layouts of backends with large numbers of qubits. This was accomplished
    by leveraging `graphviz <https://graphviz.org/>`__ through rustworkx's ``graphviz_draw()`` function
    to perform a more sophisticated algorithmic graph layout that scales for large numbers of
    qubits.

upgrade:
  - |
    The visualization functions: :func:`~.plot_gate_map`,  :func:`~.plot_coupling_map`.
    :func:`~.plot_error_map`,  and :func:`~.plot_circuit_layout` now depend on
    `graphviz <https://graphviz.org/>`__ being installed to function. This change was
    necessary to enable visualizing backends with larger numbers of qubits. This
    additional external requirement is in addition to the existing optional dependencies
    these functions previously required. You find details on how to install
    graphviz here:  https://graphviz.org/download/
