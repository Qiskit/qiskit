    The fields :attr:`.IfElseOp.condition`, :attr:`.WhileLoopOp.condition` and
    :attr:`.SwitchCaseOp.target` can now be instances of the new runtime classical-expression type
    :class:`.expr.Expr`.  This is distinct from :class:`.ParameterExpression` because it is
    evaluated *at runtime* for backends that support such operations.

    These new expressions have significantly more power than the old two-tuple form of supplying
    classical conditions.  For example, one can now represent equality constraints between two
    different classical registers, or the logic "or" of two classical bits.  These two examples
    would look like::

      from qiskit.circuit import QuantumCircuit, ClassicalRegister, QuantumRegister
      from qiskit.circuit.classical import expr

      qr = QuantumRegister(4)
      cr1 = ClassicalRegister(2)
      cr2 = ClassicalRegister(2)
      qc = QuantumCircuit(qr, cr1, cr2)
      qc.h(0)
      qc.cx(0, 1)
      qc.h(2)
      qc.cx(2, 3)
      qc.measure([0, 1, 2, 3], [0, 1, 2, 3])

      # If the two registers are equal to each other.
      with qc.if_test(expr.equal(cr1, cr2)):
        qc.x(0)

      # While either of two bits are set.
      with qc.while_loop(expr.logic_or(cr1[0], cr1[1])):
        qc.reset(0)
        qc.reset(1)
        qc.measure([0, 1], cr1)

    For more examples, see the documentation for :mod:`qiskit.circuit.classical`.

    This is a feature that hardware is only just beginning to support, so Qiskit's support is
    starting conservatively, and you may well find rough edges in places where hardware doesn't
    support expressions that look simple in Qiskit.  Please bear with us, and your hardware vendors!

    In this initial release, Qiskit has added the operations:

    * :func:`~.expr.bit_not`
    * :func:`~.expr.logic_not`
    * :func:`~.expr.bit_and`
    * :func:`~.expr.bit_or`
    * :func:`~.expr.bit_xor`
    * :func:`~.expr.logic_and`
    * :func:`~.expr.logic_or`
    * :func:`~.expr.equal`
    * :func:`~.expr.not_equal`
    * :func:`~.expr.less`
    * :func:`~.expr.less_equal`
    * :func:`~.expr.greater`
    * :func:`~.expr.greater_equal`

    These can act on Python integer and Boolean literals, or on :class:`.ClassicalRegister`
    and :class:`.Clbit` instances.

    All these classical expressions are fully supported through the Qiskit transpiler stack, through
    QPY serialization (:mod:`qiskit.qpy`) and for export to OpenQASM 3 (:mod:`qiskit.qasm3`). Import
    from OpenQASM 3 is currently managed by `a separate package <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-qasm3-import>`__
    (which is re-exposed via :mod:`qiskit.qasm3`), which we hope will be extended to match the new
    features in Qiskit.

    In addition to the new representations of classical runtime expressions, some tools for working
    with these objects have also been added.  A general :class:`~.expr.ExprVisitor` is provided for
    consumers of these expressions to subclass.  Two utilities based on this structure,
    :func:`~.expr.iter_vars` and :func:`~.expr.structurally_equivalent`, are also provided, which
    respectively produce an iterator through the :class:`~.expr.Var` nodes and check whether two
    :class:`~.expr.Expr` instances are structurally the same, up to some mapping of the
    :class:`~.expr.Var` nodes contained.

    For those who wish to convert all old-style conditions into new-style :class:`~.expr.Expr` nodes
    immediately, the function :func:`~.expr.lift_legacy_condition` is provided, though these new
    expression nodes are not permitted in old-style :attr:`.Instruction.condition` fields, which are
    due to be replaced by more advanced classical handling such as :class:`.IfElseOp`.
issues:
  - |
    Circuits containing classical expressions made with the :mod:`~.classical.expr` module are not
    yet supported by the circuit visualizers.
