    Fixed a bug where :meth:`~.Clifford.from_matrix` and :meth:`~.Clifford.from_operator`
    do not fail with non-Clifford diagonal operators (matrices) and return incorrect
    Clifford objects. This has been corrected so that they raise an error in the cases.
    Fixed `#10903 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/10903>`__
