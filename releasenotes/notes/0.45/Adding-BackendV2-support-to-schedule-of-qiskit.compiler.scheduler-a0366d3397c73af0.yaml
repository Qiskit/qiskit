    Enables circuit to pulse scheduling using BackendV2.
    
    .. code-block:: python
    
      # import a fake backend which is a sub-class of BackendV2.
      from qiskit.providers.fake_provider import FakePerth
      from qiskit.compiler.scheduler import schedule
      from qiskit.circuit import QuantumCircuit
      
      qc = QuantumCircuit(1, 1)
      qc.x(0)
      qc.measure(0,0)
      sched = schedule(circuits=qc, backend=FakePerth())

    Since, BackendV2 was not supported by the :func:`~qiskit.compiler.schedule` function, this caused
    schedule method to error out when the :code:`backend` argument is supplied with :class:`.BackendV2`. 
    Refer to `#10837 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/10837>` for more information.
