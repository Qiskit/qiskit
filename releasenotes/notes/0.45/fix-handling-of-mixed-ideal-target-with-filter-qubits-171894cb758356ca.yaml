    Fixed an issue in the :meth:`.Target.build_coupling_map` method when the
    ``filter_idle_qubits`` argument was set to ``True`` and there was a mix
    of fixed width ideal and physical instructions in the target. In these cases
    previously the :meth:`.Target.build_coupling_map` would have raised an
    exception because it was assuming all instructions in the target were
    physical and defined over qubits.
