    Added a new analysis :class:`.SabrePreLayout` pass that creates a starting
    layout for :class:`.SabreLayout`, writing the layout into the property set
    value ``sabre_starting_layouts``.

    The pass works by augmenting the coupling map with more and more "extra" edges
    until :class:`.VF2Layout` succeeds to find a perfect graph isomorphism.
    More precisely, the augmented coupling map contains edges between nodes that are
    within a given distance ``d`` in the original coupling map, and the value of ``d``
    is increased until an isomorphism is found. The pass also optionally minimizes
    the number of extra edges involved in the layout until a local minimum is found.
    This involves removing extra edges and calling :class:`.VF2Layout` to check if
    an isomorphism still exists.

    Here is an example of calling the :class:`.SabrePreLayout` before :class:`.SabreLayout`::

        import math
        from qiskit.transpiler import CouplingMap, PassManager
        from qiskit.circuit.library import EfficientSU2
        from qiskit.transpiler.passes import SabrePreLayout, SabreLayout

        qc = EfficientSU2(16, entanglement='circular', reps=6, flatten=True)
        qc.assign_parameters([math.pi / 2] * len(qc.parameters), inplace=True)
        qc.measure_all()

        coupling_map = CouplingMap.from_heavy_hex(7)

        pm = PassManager(
            [
                SabrePreLayout(coupling_map=coupling_map),
                SabreLayout(coupling_map),
            ]
        )

        pm.run(qc)
