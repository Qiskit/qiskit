upgrade:
  - |
    Removed the argument `qubit_channel_mapping` in :class:`qiskit.transpiler.passes.calibration.rzx_builder.RZXCalibrationBuilder`,
    which was deprecated in Qiskit 0.39 (released on Oct 2022, with qiskit-terra 0.22)
  - |
    Replaced the argument ``qobj[Qobj]`` in :meth:`qiskit.providers.aer.QasmSimulator.run()` with ``run_input[QuantumCircuit or Schedule or list]``

    Here is an example to migrate your code::

      # Importing necessary Qiskit libraries
      from qiskit import transpile, QuantumCircuit
      from qiskit.aer import QasmSimulator

      # Defining the Quantum Circuit
      qc = QuantumCircuit(2)
      qc.h(0)
      qc.cx(0, 1)
      qc.measure_all()

      # Transpile the circuit to optimize for the target simulator
      simulator = QasmSimulator()
      transpiled_circuit = transpile(qc, simulator)
      # Run the simulation
      job = simulator.run(transpiled_circuit, shots=1024)
      # Get the simulation result
      result = job.result()

     

    All these were deprecated since 0.22 (released on October 13, 2022) and now they are removed.
