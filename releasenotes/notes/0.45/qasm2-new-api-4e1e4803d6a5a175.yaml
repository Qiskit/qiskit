features:
  - |
    The OpenQASM 2 module :mod:`qiskit.qasm2` has gained the export functions
    :func:`~.qasm2.dump` and :func:`~.qasm2.dumps`.  These are used in a very
    similar manner to the previous :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.qasm`::

      from qiskit import qasm2, QuantumCircuit
      qc = QuantumCircuit(2, 2)
      qc.h(0)
      qc.cx(0, 1)
      qc.measure([0, 1], [0, 1])
      print(qasm2.dumps(qc))

    The new functions stem from the same code as :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.qasm`,
    which will slowly be phased out and replaced with the new paths, to provide
    a more coherent interface when compared to the OpenQASM 3
    (:mod:`qiskit.qasm3`) and QPY (:mod:`qiskit.qpy`) modules.  This is
    particularly important since the method name :meth:`~.QuantumCircuit.qasm`
    gave no indication of the OpenQASM version, and since it was originally
    added, Qiskit has gained several serialisation modules that could easily
    become confused.
deprecations:
  - |
    The little-used :class:`.QuantumCircuit` class data attributes
    :attr:`~.QuantumCircuit.header` and :attr:`~.QuantumCircuit.extension_lib`
    are deprecated and scheduled for removal.  These respectively held strings
    of the OpenQASM 2.0 version header statement and ``qelib1.inc`` include
    statement.  No alternative will be provided; these were mostly intended
    as internal details.
