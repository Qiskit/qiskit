upgrade:
  - |
    The classes ``qiskit.quantum_info.PauliTable`` and ``qiskit.quantum_info.StabilizerTable``
    are removed. The function ``random_pauli_table`` is also removed.
    They were deprecated in Qiskit 0.43 (with Terra 0.24), released in May 2023.
    Instead, you should use :class:`.PauliList` and :func:`.random_pauli_list`.
