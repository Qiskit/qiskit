    Added new methods to :class:`.TranspileLayout`, :meth:`~.TranspileLayout.initial_index_layout`
    and :meth:`~.TranspileLayout.routing_permutation`, which are used to generate a list view of
    the :attr:`.TranspileLayout.initial_layout` and
    :attr:`.TranspileLayout.final_layout` attributes respectively. For example,
    if the :attr:`~.TranspileLayout.final_layout` attribute was::

        Layout({
          qr[0]: 2,
          qr[1]: 3,
          qr[2]: 0,
          qr[3]: 1,
        })

    then :meth:`~.TranspileLayout.routing_permutation` will return::

        [2, 3, 0, 1]

    Added a new method to :class:`.TranspileLayout`, :meth:`~.TranspileLayout.initial_virtual_layout`,
    which is equivalent to the :attr:`.TranspileLayout.initial_layout` attribute but gives the option
    to filter ancilla qubits that were added to the circuit. By default the :attr:`.TranspileLayout.initial_layout`
    will typically include any ancillas added by the transpiler.

    Added a new methods, :meth:`~.TranspileLayout.final_index_layout` and :meth:`~.TranspileLayout.final_virtual_layout`
    to the :class:`~.TranspileLayout` class. These methods are used to return a final layout
    (the mapping of input circuit qubits to the final position in the output). This is distinct
    from the :attr:`~.TranspileLayout.final_layout` attribute which is the permutation caused by
    routing as a :class:`.Layout` object. The :meth:`~.TranspileLayout.final_index_layout` method
    returns a list to showthe output position for each qubit in the input circuit to the transpiler.
    For example, with an original circuit::

        qc = QuantumCircuit(3)
        qc.h(0)
        qc.cx(0, 1)
        qc.cx(0, 2)

    and the output from the transpiler was::

        tqc = QuantumCircuit(3)
        tqc.h(2)
        tqc.cx(2, 1)
        tqc.swap(0, 1)
        tqc.cx(2, 1)

    then the output from :meth:`~.TranspileLayout.final_index_layout` would return a
    list of::

        [2, 0, 1]

    The :meth:`~.TranspileLayout.final_virtual_layout` returns this as a :class:`.Layout` object,
    so the return from the above example would be::

        Layout({
          qc.qubits[0]: 2,
          qc.qubits[1]: 0,
          qc.qubits[2]: 1,
        })
