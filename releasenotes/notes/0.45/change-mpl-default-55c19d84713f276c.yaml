    The default ``matplotlib`` drawer setting now issues a ``FutureWarning``, as the default
    style is changing to the ``"iqp"`` style (previously known as ``"iqx"``). The old default is 
    available as the ``"clifford"`` style.
    To silence the warning, you can explicitly set the desired style, e.g.::

      from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
      
      circuit = QuantumCircuit(2)
      circuit.x(0)
      circuit.h(0)
      circuit.cp(0.5, 0, 1)

      circuit.draw("mpl", style="clifford")  # or style="iqp"
features:

    Add the ``"iqp"`` and ``"iqp-dark"`` color styles for the ``matplotlib`` circuit drawer,
    which are based on the IBM Quantum Platform color scheme.
