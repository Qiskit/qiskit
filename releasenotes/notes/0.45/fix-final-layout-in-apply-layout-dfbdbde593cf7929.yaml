    Fixed an issue with the :func:`~.transpile` function and all the preset
    pass managers generated via :func:`~.generate_preset_pass_manager` where
    the output :class:`~.QuantumCircuit` object's :attr:`~.QuantumCircuit.layout`
    attribute would have an invalid :attr:`.TranspileLayout.final_layout`
    attribute. This would occur in scenarios when the :class:`~.VF2PostLayout`
    pass would run and find an alternative initial layout that has lower
    reported error rates. When altering the initial layout the
    :attr:`~.TranspileLayout.final_layout` attribute was never updated to
    reflect this change. This has been corrected so that the ``final_layout``
    is always correctly reflecting the output permutation caused by the routing
    stage.
    Fixed `#10457 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/10457>`__
