    This version of Qiskit is explicitly pinned to the Numpy 1.x series, because it includes compiled
    extensions that are not yet compiled against the as-yet-unreleased Numpy 2.x series.  We will
    release a new version of Qiskit with Numpy 2.x support as soon as feasible.

    We cannot prevent your package manager from resolving to older versions of Qiskit (which do not
    have the same pin but are still likely to be incompatible) if you forcibly try to install Qiskit
    alongside Numpy 2, before we have released a compatible version.
