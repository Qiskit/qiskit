    QPY supports the use of symengine-native serialization and deserialization
    for objects of type ``ParameterExpression`` as well as symbolic expressions in
    Pulse schedule blocks. This is a faster serialization alternative, but not
    supported in all platforms. Please check that your target platform is supported
    by the symengine library before setting this option, as it will be **required**
    by qpy to deserialize the payload.

    The feature can be enabled through the ``use_symengine`` parameter
    in :meth:`.qpy.dump`:

    .. code-block:: python

      from qiskit.circuit import QuantumCircuit, Parameter
      from qiskit import qpy

      theta = Parameter("theta")
      phi = Parameter("phi")
      sum_param = theta + phi

      qc = QuantumCircuit(1)
      qc.rz(sum_param, 0)
      qc.measure_all()

      with open('bell.qpy', 'wb') as fd:
          qpy.dump(qc, fd, use_symengine=True)

      with open('bell.qpy', 'rb') as fd:
          new_qc = qpy.load(fd)[0]
