features:
  - |
    :class:`.Parameter` now has an advanced-usage keyword argument ``uuid`` in its constructor,
    which can be used to make the :class:`.Parameter` compare equal to another of the same name.
    This should not typically be used by users, and is most useful for custom serialization and
    deserialization.
fixes:
  - |
    The hash of a :class:`.Parameter` is now equal to the hashes of any
    :class:`.ParameterExpression` that it compares equal to.  Previously the hashes were different,
    which would cause spurious additional entries in hashmaps when :class:`.Parameter` and
    :class:`.ParameterExpression` values were mixed in the same map as it violated Python's data model.
