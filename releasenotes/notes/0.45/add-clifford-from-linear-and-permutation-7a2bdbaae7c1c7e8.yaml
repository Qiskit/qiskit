    Added :meth:`.Clifford.from_linear_function` and :meth:`.Clifford.from_permutation`
    methods that create a ``Clifford`` object from :class:`~.LinearFunction`
    and from :class:`~.PermutationGate` respectively. As a consequence, a ``Clifford``
    can now be constructed directly from a ``LinearFunction``, a ``PermutationGate``, or
    a quantum circuit containing such gates.
