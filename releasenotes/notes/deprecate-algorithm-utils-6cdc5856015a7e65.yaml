deprecations:
  - |
    The algorithm utils in ``qiskit.utils.validation`` and ``qiskit.utils.algorithm_globals``
    are now deprecated and will be removed in no less than 3 months from the release date.
    These utils were introduced with the ``qiskit.algorithms`` module to support
    legacy and primitive-based algorithm workflows. Now that ``qiskit.algorithms`` is deprecated
    and the primitive-based algorithms codebase has been migrated to a standalone
    `library <https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-algorithms>`_, these utils are no
    longer used in the context of Qiskit. If your application allows it, we recommend that
    you migrate your code to use ``qiskit_algorithms``, where you will be able to import
    the relevant utilities in ``algorithm_globals`` and ``validation`` from
    ``qiskit_algorithms.utils``. Please note that legacy functionality has not been migrated
    to the new package.
