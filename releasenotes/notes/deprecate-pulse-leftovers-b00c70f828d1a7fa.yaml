    As part of Pulse deprecation in version 1.3, the calibration builder passes
    were also deprecated and in particular :class:`.RXCalibrationBuilder`. The
    :class:`.NormalizeRXAngle` pass is a requirement of :class:`.RXCalibrationBuilder`
    hence it should also be deprecated. In addition, the :func:`.rzx_templates`
    function in the calibration module is being deprecated as it is not used.
