    Fixed an issue where :func:`~qiskit.visualization.plot_histogram` would
    incorrectly detect probability distributions as counts when the dictionary
    contained integer zeros before float probability values. The function now
    checks all values in the dictionary to determine if any are floats, rather
    than only checking the first value. This fixes cases where distributions
    like ``{0: 0, 1: 0, 2: 0.5, 3: 0.5}`` were incorrectly treated as counts
    and had their values coerced to integers, resulting in an empty plot.
    Fixes `#11949 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/11949>`__.
