    Fixed an issue with QPY deserialization via the :func:`.qpy.load` function
    of the :class:`~.UCRXGate`, :class:`~.UCRYGate`, and :class:`~.UCRZGate`
    classes.
    Previously, a QPY file that contained any of these gates would error
    when trying to load the file.
    Fixed `#7847 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/7847>`__.

    QPY deserialization with the :func:`.qpy.load` function of a directly
    instantiated :class:`~.UCPauliRotGate` object in a circuit will fail
    because the rotation axis argument to the class isn't stored in a standard
    place. To workaround this you can instead use the subclasses:
    :class:`~.UCRXGate`, :class:`~.UCRYGate`, or :class:`~.UCRZGate` (based on
    whether you're using a rotation axis of ``"X"``, ``"Y"``, or ``"Z"``
    respectively) which embeds the rotation axis in the class constructor and
    will work correctly in QPY.
