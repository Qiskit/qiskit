    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.Register` and :class:`~qiskit.circuit.Bit` objects
    are now immutable. In previous releases it was possible to adjust the value
    of a :attr:`~qiskit.circuit.Register.size` or
    :attr:`~qiskit.circuit.Register.name` attributes of a
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.Register` object and the
    :attr:`~qiskit.circuit.Bit.index` or :attr:`~qiskit.circuit.Bit.register`
    attributes of a :class:`~qiskit.circuit.Bit` object after it was initially
    created. However this would lead to unsound behavior that would corrupt
    container structure that rely on a hash (such as a `dict`) since these
    attributes are treated as immutable properties of a register or bit (see
    `#4705 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/4705>`__ for more
    details). To avoid this unsound behavior this attributes of a
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.Register` and :class:`~qiskit.circuit.Bit` are
    no longer settable after initial creation. If you were previously adjusting
    the objects at runtime you will now need to create a new ``Register`
    or ``Bit`` object with the new values.
