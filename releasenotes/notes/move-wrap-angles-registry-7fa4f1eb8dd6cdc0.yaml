    The preferred location for the default registry for the :class:`.WrapAngles` transpiler pass is
    now :attr:`.WrapAngles.DEFAULT_REGISTRY`.  The previous deeply nested
    :data:`.WRAP_ANGLES_REGISTRY` path will continue to work for backwards compatibility, but we
    encourage downstream packages to use the new location.  The previous path was an oversight in
    Qiskit 2.2, and traverse modules that were never intended to be part of the public API.
