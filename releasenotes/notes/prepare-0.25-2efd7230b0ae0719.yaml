  The Qiskit Terra 0.25.0 release highlights are:

  * Control-flow operations are now supported through the transpiler at
    all optimization levels, including levels 2 and 3 (e.g. calling
    :func:`.transpile` or :func:`.generate_preset_pass_manager` with
    keyword argument ``optimization_level`` specified as 2 or 3 is now
    supported).

  Qiskit Terra 0.25 has dropped support for Python 3.7 following
  deprecation warnings started in Qiskit Terra 0.23. This is consistent
  with Python 3.7â€™s end-of-life on the 27th of June, 2023. To continue
  using Qiskit, you must upgrade to a more recent version of Python.
