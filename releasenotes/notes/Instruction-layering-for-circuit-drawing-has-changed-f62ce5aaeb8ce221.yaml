    Instructions layering which underlies all types of circuit drawing has
    changed to address right/left justification. This sometimes results in
    output which is topologically equivalent to the rendering in prior versions
    but visually different than previously rendered. The change in layering
    fixes qiskit-terra issue \#2802
