upgrade:
  - |
    The function :func:`~qiskit.execute_function.execute`
    does not accept the arguments `qobj_id` and  `qobj_header` any more.
    Their use was deprecated in Qiskit 0.37 (with Terra 0.21), released on June 2022.    
  - |
    The transpilation pass ``qiskit.transpiler.passes.ALAPSchedule`` is removed. It use was deprecated 
    in Qiskit 0.37 (with Terra 0.21), released on June 2022 and replaced by 
    :class:`~.transpiler.passes.ALAPScheduleAnalysis`, which is an
    analysis pass.
  - |
    The transpilation pass ``qiskit.transpiler.passes.ASAPSchedule`` is removed. It use was deprecated 
    in Qiskit 0.37 (with Terra 0.21), released on June 2022. It has been superseded by
    :class:`~.ASAPScheduleAnalysis` and the new scheduling workflow.
  - |
    The transpilation pass ``qiskit.transpiler.passes.DynamicalDecoupling`` is removed. It use was deprecated 
    in Qiskit 0.37 (with Terra 0.21), released on June 2022.
    Instead, use :class:`~.transpiler.passes.PadDynamicalDecoupling`, which performs the same
    function but requires scheduling and alignment analysis passes to run prior to it.
  - |
    The transpilation pass ``qiskit.transpiler.passes.AlignMeasures`` is removed. It use was deprecated 
    in Qiskit 0.37 (with Terra 0.21), released on June 2022.
    Instead, use :class:`~.ConstrainedReschedule`, which performs the same function 
    and also supports aligning to additional timing constraints.
  - |
    The transpilation pass ``qiskit.transpiler.passes.CXDirection`` is removed. It use was deprecated 
    in Qiskit 0.37 (with Terra 0.21), released on June 2022.
    Instead, use the more generic :class:`~.GateDirection` pass.
  - |
    The transpilation pass ``qiskit.transpiler.passes.CheckCXDirection`` is removed. It use was deprecated 
    in Qiskit 0.37 (with Terra 0.21), released on June 2022.
    Instead, use the more generic :class:`~.CheckGateDirection` pass.
  - |
    The methods ``to_dict`` in the classes :class:`.pulse.transforms.AlignmentKind`,
    `.pulse.transforms.AlignEquispaced`, and :class:`.pulse.transforms.AlignFunc` are removed.
    They were deprecated 
    in Qiskit 0.37 (with Terra 0.21), released on June 2022.
  - |
    The argument ``circuits`` in the method :meth:`qiskit.qpy.interface.dump`
    is removed as its usage was deprecated 
    in Qiskit 0.37 (with Terra 0.21), released on June 2022.
    Instead, use the argument ``programs``, which behaves identically.
