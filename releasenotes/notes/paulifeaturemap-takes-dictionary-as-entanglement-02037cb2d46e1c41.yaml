    The entanglement argument in `PauliFeatureMap` and `ZZFeatureMap` will no longer support List[int] or List[List[int]]. Instead,
    the entanglement structure in `PauliFeatureMap` and `ZZFeatureMap` can now be specified as a dictionary where the keys represent  
    the number of qubits, and the values are lists of integer tuples that define which qubits are entangled with one another. This
    allows for more flexibility in constructing feature maps tailored to specific quantum algorithms.
    Example usage::
            from qiskit.circuit.library import PauliFeatureMap

            entanglement = {
                    1: [(0,), (2,)],
                    2: [(0, 1), (1, 2)],
                    3: [(0, 1, 2)],
            }
            params=[0, 1, 3.14]
            qc = PauliFeatureMap(3, reps=2, paulis=['Z', 'ZZ', 'ZZZ'], entanglement=entanglement, insert_barriers=True)
            qc.decompose().draw('mpl')
