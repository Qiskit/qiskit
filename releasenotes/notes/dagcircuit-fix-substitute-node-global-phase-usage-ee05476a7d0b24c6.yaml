upgrade:
  - |
    The ``DAGCircuit.__eq__`` method, which is used to check structural equality
    of :class:`~qiskit.dagcircuit.DAGCircuit` and :class:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit` instances, has been updated to
    include the ``global_phase`` and ``calibrations`` attributes in fields
    checked for equality.
fixes:
  - |
    The :class:`~qiskit.transpiler.passes.BasisTranslator` and :class:`~qiskit.transpiler.passes.Unroller` passes, in some cases, had not been
    preserving the global phase of the circuit under transpilation. This has
    been fixed.
