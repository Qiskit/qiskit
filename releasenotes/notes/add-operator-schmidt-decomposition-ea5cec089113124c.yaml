    Added :func:operator_schmidt_decomposition. This function
    computes the **operator Schmidt decomposition** of an operator acting on `n` qubits
    across a specified bipartition. It returns:

      * The full set of singular values (Schmidt coefficients).
      * Lists of Schmidt factors `A_r` and `B_r` in the permuted basis.
      * Partition and permutation metadata, including the permutation matrix.
      * Optional reconstruction of the operator in the original qubit order.
      * Truncation support: keep only the top-`k` Schmidt terms with Frobenius-optimal
        error reporting.

    This utility is useful for analyzing entanglement structure of operators, validating
    tensor decompositions, and benchmarking low-rank approximations.
