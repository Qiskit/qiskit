upgrade:
  - |
    Improve normalization in the ``BaseEstimator`` primitive observable validation 
    functionality, parsing to the more specific type ``tuple[SparsePauliOp, ...]``.
  - |
    Let the ``BaseEstimator.run()`` method accept ``PauliList``, ``Pauli`` and ``str`` 
    types, both directly or as elements in a ``Sequence`` object.
