    Support for extensions of the ``qiskit`` and ``qiskit.providers`` namespaces
    by external packages has been removed. Support for doing this was deprecated
    in the Qiskit 0.44.0 release. In the past, the Qiskit project was composed
    of elements that extended a shared namespace and hook points were added
    to enable doing that. However, it was not intended for these interfaces to
    ever be used by other packages. Now that the overall Qiskit package is no
    longer using that packaging model, leaving the possibility for these
    extensions carry more risk than benefits and has therefore been removed.
    If youâ€™re maintaining a package that extends the Qiskit namespace (i.e.
    your users import from ``qiskit.x`` or ``qiskit.providers.y``) you should
    transition to using a standalone Python namespace for your package.
