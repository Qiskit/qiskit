    Fixed an issue with the matplotlib based visualization in the
    :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.draw` method and the :func:`~.circuit_drawer`
    function when visualizing circuits that had control flow instructions.
    Previously in some situations, especially with a layout set, the output
    visualization could have put gates inside a control flow block on the
    wrong wires in the visualization.

    Fixed an issue with the matplotlib based visualization in the
    :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.draw` method and the :func:`~.circuit_drawer`
    function when visualizing circuits that had control flow instructions.
    Previously when the `cregbundle` option was set to None or True, the
    drawer did not properly display the `cregs` as bundled.
