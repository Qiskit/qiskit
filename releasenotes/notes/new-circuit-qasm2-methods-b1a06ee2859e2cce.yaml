upgrade:
  - |
    The OpenQASM 2 constructor methods on :class:`.QuantumCircuit`
    (:meth:`~.QuantumCircuit.from_qasm_str` and :meth:`~.QuantumCircuit.from_qasm_file`) have been
    switched to use the Rust-based parser added in Qiskit Terra 0.24.  This should result in
    significantly faster parsing times (10 times or more is not uncommon) and massively reduced
    intermediate memory usage.

    The :class:`.QuantumCircuit` methods are kept with the same interface for continuity; the
    preferred way to access the OpenQASM 2 importer is to use :func:`.qasm2.load` and
    :func:`.qasm2.loads`, which offer an expanded interface to control the parsing and construction.
fixes:
  - |
    The OpenQASM 2 circuit-constructor methods (:meth:`.QuantumCircuit.from_qasm_str` and
    :meth:`~.QuantumCircuit.from_qasm_file`) will no longer error when encountering a ``gate``
    definition that contains ``U`` or ``CX`` instructions. See `#5536
    <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/5536>`__.
