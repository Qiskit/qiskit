    Added a feature for bloch vectors to be plotted using spherical coordinates.
    Implements feature mentioned in issue `#4802 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/4802>`

    Cartesian coordinates are still supported and made as the default mode.
    for example::
    
    .. jupyter-execute::

      from qiskit.visualization import plot_bloch_vector

      # Cartesian coordinates, where (x,y,z) are cartesian coordinates for bloch vector 
      plot_bloch_vector([x,y,z])
      plot_bloch_vector([x,y,z], coord_type="cartesian")  # Same as line above

      # Spherical coordinates, where (r,theta,phi) are spherical coordinates for bloch vector
      plot_bloch_vector([r,theta,phi], coord_type="spherical")

    It should be noted that angles should be in radians and r is radius, theta is inclination from +z direction,
    and phi is azimuth from +x direction.
