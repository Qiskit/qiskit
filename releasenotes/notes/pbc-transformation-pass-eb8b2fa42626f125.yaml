# Delete all sections that you do not need.  You can have more than one section in a file, and
# more than one bullet point per section.  This is a regular YAML file, and all text should use
# Sphinx's flavor of rST (restructured text).  Each bullet point is a separate "release note".
#
# Each public bug fix, feature, deprecation, and behavior change needs a release note.
# Documentation- or internal-only changes do not need release notes.
#
# Each bullet point appears without any context, so make sure each can be read in isolation.  The
# reader will not see your code change, the issue, or any other bullet points in this file.  You
# might need to repeat yourself between bullets.
#
# Use Sphinx cross-references like :meth:`.YourClass.your_method` whenever mentioning a
# function/class/method by name.
#
# Use `- |` for multiline YAML strings (like in the "fixes" example in this template) to preserve
# newlines, which you need for Sphinx syntax.
#
# There are some rare additional sections listed in `releasenotes/config.yaml` not included here.

    Added a new transpiler pass :class:`.PBCTransformation`,
    that converts a quanutm circuit containing single-qubit and two-qubit standard gates,
    barriers and measurements, into an equivalent list of Pauli product rotations,
    implemented as :class:`.PauliEvolutionGate`, and a global phase.
