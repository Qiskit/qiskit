    Added a new transpiler pass :class:`.PBCTransformation`,
    that converts a quantum circuit containing single-qubit, two-qubit and three-qubit 
    standard gates, barriers and measurements, into an equivalent list of Pauli product rotations,
    implemented as :class:`.PauliEvolutionGate` and a global phase, as well as
    :class:`.PauliProductMeasurement`.
