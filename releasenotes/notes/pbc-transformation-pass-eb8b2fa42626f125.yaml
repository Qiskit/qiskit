    Added a new transpiler pass :class:`.PBCTransformation`,
    that converts a quanutm circuit containing single-qubit and two-qubit standard gates,
    barriers and measurements, into an equivalent list of Pauli product rotations,
    implemented as :class:`.PauliEvolutionGate`, and a global phase.
