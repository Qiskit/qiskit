fixes:
  - |
    Fixed the :meth:`.Gate.control` method to correctly handle the edge case where 
    ``num_ctrl_qubits`` is 0. Previously, this could raise an error or cause a core
    dump. Now it returns a copy of the original gate.

    Fixed `#15666 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/15666>`__.

  - |
    Fixed the :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.mcrx`, :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.mcry`,
    :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.mcrz`, :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.mcp`, and
    :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.mcx` methods when appending multi-controlled
    gates with no control qubits. Previously, this could lead to memory overflows.
    This case is now handled correctly.

    Fixed `#15664 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/15664>`__.

  - |
    Fixed the definition of :class:`MCPhaseGate` for the case of 0 controls
    qubits.
