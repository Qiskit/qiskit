    Fixed a bug in :meth:`.SparsePauliOp.simplify` where the method removed
    Pauli terms based on their coefficients' magnitudes before combining
    duplicates. This caused incorrect behavior in two key edge cases:

    1. When multiple identical Pauli terms had small coefficients that were individually
       below the simplification threshold but whose sum exceeded the threshold,
       those terms were incorrectly removed.
    2. When multiple identical Pauli terms had coefficients above the threshold but
       summed to near-zero, they were incorrectly kept.

    See `#14194 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/14194>`__ for more detail.
