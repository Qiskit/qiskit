    Fixed a bug in :meth:`.SparsePauliOp.simplify` where the method removed
    Pauli terms based on their coefficients' magnitudes **before** combining
    duplicates. This caused incorrect behavior in two key edge cases:

    1. When multiple identical Pauli terms had small coefficients that were individually
       below the simplification threshold but whose **sum exceeded the threshold**,
       those terms were incorrectly removed.
    2. When multiple identical Pauli terms had coefficients above the threshold but
       **summed to near-zero**, they were incorrectly kept.

    The fix ensures that duplicate Pauli strings are now summed **before** tolerance-based
    filtering is applied.

    Thanks to `#14194 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/14194>`__ for the report,
    and `#14425 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/pull/14425>`__ for the fix.
