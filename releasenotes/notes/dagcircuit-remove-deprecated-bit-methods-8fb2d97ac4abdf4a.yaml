upgrade:
  - |
    The ``qubits()`` and ``clbits()`` methods on the
    :class:`~qiskit.dagcircuit.DAGCircuit` class, which were deprecated in the
    0.15.0 Terra release, have been removed. They are replaced by the
    :attr:`~qiskit.dagcircuit.DAGCircuit.qubits` and
    :attr:`~qiskit.dagcircuit.DAGCircuit.clbits` attributes.
