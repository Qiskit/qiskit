    Add a synthesis function :func:`.synth_mcx_n_dirty_i15` that
    synthesizes a multi-controlled X gate with :math:`k` controls using :math:`k - 2`
    dirty ancillary qubits producing a circuit with at most :math:`8 * k - 6` CX gates,
    by Iten et. al. (arXiv:1501.06911).

    Add a synthesis function :func:`.synth_mcx_n_clean_m15` that
    synthesizes a multi-controlled X gate with :math:`k` controls using :math:`k - 2`
    clean ancillary qubits producing a circuit with at most :math:`6 * k - 6` CX gates,
    by Maslov (arXiv:1508.03273).

    Add a synthesis function :func:`.synth_mcx_1_clean_b95` that
    synthesizes a multi-controlled X gate with :math:`k` controls using a single
    clean ancillary qubit producing a circuit with at most :math:`16 * k - 8` CX gates,
    by Barenco et al. (arXiv:quant-ph/9503016).
