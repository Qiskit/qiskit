    There were two bugs in the ``text`` circuit drawer that were fixed.
    These appeared when ``vertical_compression`` was set to ``medium``,
    which is the default. The first would sometimes cause text to overwrite
    other text or gates, and the second would sometimes cause the connections
    between a gate and its controls to break.
    See `#8588 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/8588>`__.
