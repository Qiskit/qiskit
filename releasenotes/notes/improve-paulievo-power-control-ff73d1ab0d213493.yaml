    Improved :meth:`.PauliEvolutionGate.control` and :meth:`.PauliEvolutionGate.power` to return
    more efficient representations in terms of a :class:`.PauliEvolutionGate`. This change leads
    to significantly shallower circuits and gate counts compared to the previously used
    generic power and control mechanisms.
