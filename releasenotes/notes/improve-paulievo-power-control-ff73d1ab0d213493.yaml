    Improved :meth:`.PauliEvolutionGate.control`, :meth:`.PauliEvolutionGate.power` and 
    :meth:`.PauliEvolutionGate.inverse` to return more efficient representations in terms of 
    a :class:`.PauliEvolutionGate`. For computing the controlled and exponentiated versions of the 
    evolution gate this change leads to significantly shallower circuits and lower
    gate counts compared to the previously used generic mechanisms. The inverse decomposition
    does not change but is now generated more efficiently and allows for better compiler 
    optimizations.
