    Add new :meth:`~qiskit.pulse.gaussian_square_echo` pulse shape. This pulse
    is composed by three :class:`~qiskit.pulse.GaussianSquare` pulses. The 
    first two are echo pulses with duration half of the total duration and
    implement rotary tones. The third pulse is a cancellation tone that lasts
    the full duration of the pulse and implements correcting single qubit
    rotations.
