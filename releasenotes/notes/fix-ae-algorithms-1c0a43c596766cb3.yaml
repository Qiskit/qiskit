    Fix the amplitude estimation algorithms in :mod:`.amplitude_estimators` for the usage
    with the :class:`.BaseSampler` primitive. Previously, the measurements results were 
    expanded to more bits than actually measured which, for oracles with more than one qubit,
    led to potential errors in the detection of the "good" quantum states for oracles.
