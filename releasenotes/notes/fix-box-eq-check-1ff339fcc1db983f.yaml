    Fixed a bug in the :class:`.DAGOpNode` equality check, where comparing two :class:`.DAGOpNode`
    objects that contain a :class:`.BoxOp` instruction. Previously, the :attr:`.BoxOp.unit` attribute was not
    considered as part of the equality check which could lead to a two unequal nodes be evaluated as
    equal.
