    A new method, :meth:`.DAGCircuit.structurally_equal`, can be used to if two :class:`.DAGCircuit`
    instances have been created and modified in the exact same order.  This is a much stronger test
    than the standard semantic equivalence check of the ``==`` overload, and can be used by
    transpiler-pass authors to verify that their modification orders are deterministic.
