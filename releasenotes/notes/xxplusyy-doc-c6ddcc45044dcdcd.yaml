    Since its original introduction in Qiskit Terra 0.20, :class:`.XXPlusYYGate`
    has used a negative angle convention compared to all other rotation gates.
    In Qiskit Terra 0.21, this will be corrected to be brought in line with the
    other rotation gates.  This does not affect any other rotation gates, nor
    :class:`.XXMinusYYGate`.
