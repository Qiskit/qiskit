    Added the ability for analysis passes to set custom heuristic weights
    for the the :class:`~.VF2Layout` and :class:`~.VF2PostLayout` transpiler
    passes. If an analysis pass sets the ``vf2_avg_error_map`` key in the
    property set that will be used for the error weights instead of using
    the error rates in the backend's :class:`~.Target` (or
    :class:`~.BackendProperties` for :class:`~.BackendV1`). The value should be
    an 2d Numpy array where each value represents the avg error rate for all
    1 or 2 qubit operation on those qubits. ``NaN`` can be used to represent
    the lackof error or support for running gates on that qubit. For example::

        [[0.0024, 0.01],
         [NaN, 0.0032]]

    represents the error map for a 2 qubit target, where the avg 1q error rate
    is ``0.0024`` on qubit 0 and ``0.0032`` on qubit 1. Then the avg 2q error
    rate for gates that operate on (0, 1) is 0.01 and (1, 0) is not supported.
