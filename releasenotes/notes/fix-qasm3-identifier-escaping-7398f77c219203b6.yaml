    Fixed an issue where the OpenQASM 3 exporter would produce invalid
    identifiers when register names started with ASCII digits (e.g., ``3qr``)
    or contained Unicode number characters (e.g., ``²``). These invalid
    characters are now properly escaped to underscores.
    Fixes `#15304 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/15304>`__ and
    `#15303 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/15303>`__.
