    Fixed an issue in :class:`~qiskit.primitives.BindingsArray` shape inference that
    collapsed trailing singleton axes for single-parameter sweeps.  Parameter
    bindings shaped like ``(n, 1)`` now retain their final dimension, so
    primitives such as :class:`~qiskit.primitives.StatevectorEstimator` accept
    column-vector sweeps when broadcasting against observable arrays.
