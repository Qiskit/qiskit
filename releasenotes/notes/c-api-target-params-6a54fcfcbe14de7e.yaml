    Fixed a mismatch in :c:struct:`QkTargetOp` in which the length of the array
    stored in :c:member:`QkTargetOp.params` did not match the number exposed by
    :c:member:`QkTargetOp.num_params`. Wildcard parameters are now represented
    by ``NAN``, and the length of the array will always be :c:member:`QkTargetOp.num_params`.
    This bug was only present in 2.3.0rc1.
