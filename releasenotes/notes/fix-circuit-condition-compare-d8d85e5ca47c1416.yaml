    The equality checkers for :class:`.QuantumCircuit` and :class:`.DAGCircuit`
    (with objects of the same type) will now correctly handle conditions on single
    bits.  Previously, these would produce false negatives for equality, as the
    bits would use "exact" equality checks instead of the "semantic" checks the rest
    of the properties of circuit instructions get.
