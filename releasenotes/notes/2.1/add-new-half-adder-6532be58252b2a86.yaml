features_synthesis:

    Added a new synthesis algorithm for :class:`.HalfAdderGate` that requires no ancillary qubits
    and has better CX count compared to :func:`.adder_qft_d00`:

    * :func:`.adder_ripple_r25`

features_transpiler:
  - |
    Added a new high-level-synthesis plugin for synthesizing a :class:`.HalfAdderGate`:

    * :class:`.HalfAdderSynthesisR25`, based on :func:`.adder_ripple_r25`.

    The :class:`.HalfAdderSynthesisDefault` has also been updated to follow the following sequence
    of half adder synthesizers: ``"HalfAdder.ripple_r25"`` when there are
    :math:`\leq 3` qubits, ``"HalfAdder.ripple_c04"`` when one ancillary qubit is available, and
    ``"HalfAdder.ripple_r25"`` in all remaining cases.

upgrade_circuits:
  - |
    The circuit definition of :class:`.HalfAdderGate` has been upgraded to use
    :func:`.adder_ripple_r25`. To obtain the old behavior, use
    :func:`.adder_qft_d00` instead.
