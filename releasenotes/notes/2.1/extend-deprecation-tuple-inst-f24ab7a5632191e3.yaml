    The deprecated tuple-like interface for :class:`~.circuit.CircuitInstruction` was not
    removed in this release as originally planned. It will be removed in Qiskit v3.0
    instead. Instead, use the
    :attr:`~.circuit.CircuitInstruction.operation`,
    :attr:`~.circuit.CircuitInstruction.qubits`, and
    :attr:`~.circuit.CircuitInstruction.clbits` named attributes.
