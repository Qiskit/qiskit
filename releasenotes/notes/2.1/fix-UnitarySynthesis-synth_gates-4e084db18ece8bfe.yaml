    Fixed a bug in the :class:`.UnitarySynthesis` transpiler pass, where the pass ignored the
    ``synth_gates`` parameter and only synthesized the ``unitary`` gates. The pass now correctly
    synthesizes all gates specified in the ``synth_gates`` parameter.
    Fixed `#14343 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/14343>`__.
