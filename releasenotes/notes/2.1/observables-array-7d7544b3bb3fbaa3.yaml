    Estimator PUBs can now be defined using :class:`.SparseObservable` objects, in addition to
    the existing options of `str`, `Pauli`, `SparsePauliOp`, and `Mapping[Union[str, Pauli], float]`.
    However, projective observables are not yet supported when executing circuits. Projective
    observables are `0, 1, +, -, r, l`. Currently only Paulis are supported: `I, X, Y, Z`.
