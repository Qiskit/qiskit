    :ref:`The built-in layout plugins <transpiler-preset-stage-layout>` for the present pass
    managers will no longer contain their principal component (e.g. a :class:`.SabreLayout` instance
    for :ref:`the "sabre" stage <transpiler-preset-stage-layout-sabre>`) if no coupling constraints
    are provided.  Previously, the plugins would construct invalid instances of their layout passes,
    under an assumption that separate logic would prevent the passes from executing and raising
    exceptions.

    This should have no meaningful effect on the use of the preset pass managers or the plugins,
    since it was already never valid to call the passes in an invalid state .
