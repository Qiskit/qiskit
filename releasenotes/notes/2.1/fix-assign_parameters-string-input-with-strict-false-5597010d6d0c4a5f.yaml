    Fixed a bug in the :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.assign_parameters` method where parameters
    that were not used in the circuit and were passed as strings were not ignored when
    the argument ``strict=False`` was set.
    Refer to `issue #13933 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/13933>`_ for more details.
