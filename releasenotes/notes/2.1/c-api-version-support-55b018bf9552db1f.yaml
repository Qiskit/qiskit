    Added support for querying the Qiskit version information from the C API via the following macros:
    
    * ``QISKIT_VERSION_MAJOR`` : Contains the major version number.
    * ``QISKIT_VERSION_MINOR`` : Contains the minor version number.
    * ``QISKIT_VERSION_PATCH`` : Contains the patch version number.
    * ``QISKIT_VERSION`` : Contains a numeric representation of the version information, which can be used for comparisons.
    * ``QISKIT_VERSION_NUMERIC(M,m,p)`` : Function-like Macro that returns the version "M.m.p" as a numeric value, which can be used for comparisons.

    For example, to check if the current version is at least 2.1.0, you can use:

    .. code-block: c

        if (QISKIT_VERSION >= QISKIT_VERSION_NUMERIC(2, 1, 0)) {
            // Code for version 2.1.0 or later
        }
