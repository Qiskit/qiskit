    Circuits containing delays with stretches (see :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.add_stretch`) can now
    successfully compile using the preset pass-managers (:func:`.transpile` and
    :func:`.generate_preset_pass_manager`) when targetting a backend that has alignment constraints,
    for example IBM Quantum Eagle devices like ``ibm_sherbrooke``.
