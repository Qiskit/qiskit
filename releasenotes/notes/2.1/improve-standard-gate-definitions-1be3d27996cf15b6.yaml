    The definitions of certain standard gates have been updated
    according to the following principles:

    * When available, a definition using Clifford gates is preferred over
      one that includes non-Clifford gates.
    * When available, a definition using Clifford+T gates is preferred over
      one that includes ``UGate``.
    * The use of ``PhaseGate`` is preferred over ``U1Gate``.
    * The use of ``UGate`` is preferred over ``U2Gate`` and ``U3Gate``.

    Crucially, the following invariant still holds: by recursively expanding
    gate definitions, any gate can be ultimately expressed using only the
    ``["cx", "u"]`` basis.
