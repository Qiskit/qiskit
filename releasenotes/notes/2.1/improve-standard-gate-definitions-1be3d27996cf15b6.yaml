    The :attr:`~.Gate.definition` atributes of several :ref:`standard gates <standard-gates>`
    have been updated according to the following principles:

    * When available, a definition using Clifford gates is preferred over
      definitions that includes non-Clifford gates.
    * When available, a definition using Clifford+T gates is preferred over
      one that uses a :class:`.UGate`.
    * The use of :class:`.PhaseGate` is preferred over :class:`.U1Gate`.
    * The use of :class:`.UGate` is preferred over :class:`.`U2Gate` and :class:`.`U3Gate`.

    Crucially, the following invariant still holds: by recursively expanding
    gate definitions, any gate can be ultimately expressed using only the
    ``["cx", "u"]`` basis. The definitions of all the standard gates are
    all equivalent so no semantics behind the gates change, just the exact
    circuit construction returned for some gates is no longer exactly the
    same. This change was necessary to support Clifford+T transpilation.
