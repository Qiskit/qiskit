    The definitions of certain standard gates have been updated
    according to the following principles:

    * When available, a definition using Clifford gates is preferred over
      one that includes non-Clifford gates.
    * When available, a definition using Clifford+T gates is preferred over
      one that includes :class:`.UGate`.
    * The use of :class:`.PhaseGate` is preferred over :class:`.U1Gate`.
    * The use of :class:`.UGate` is preferred over :class:`.`U2Gate` and :class:`.`U3Gate`.

    Crucially, the following invariant still holds: by recursively expanding
    gate definitions, any gate can be ultimately expressed using only the
    ``["cx", "u"]`` basis.
