    A new class, :class:`.PauliLindbladMap`, is added, which is a Pauli-based parametrization of
    a subset of quantum channels, used in noise-learning applications.  This class is expected to
    form the backbone of enhanced noise-learning algorithms, and provide better and more effiicent
    control over noise models in future versions of Qiskit.

    Introduced the :class:`.QubitSparsePauli` and :class:`.QubitSparsePauliList` classes, which
    represent the same concepts as :class:`.Pauli` and :class:`.PauliList` respectively, but only
    store non-identity terms, in a manner analogous to :class:`.SparseObservable`.  These classes
    are primarily intended to be used with teh new :class:`.PauliLindbladMap`.
