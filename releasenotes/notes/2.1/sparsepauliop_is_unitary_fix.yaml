    The `SparsePauliOp.is_unitary()` method has been updated to correctly
    propagate the input `atol` (absolute tolerance) and `rtol` (relative tolerance)
    parameters to its internal call to `SparsePauliOp.simplify()`.

    Previously, `is_unitary()` might incorrectly return `False` for operators
    that were numerically unitary but contained very small, non-zero
    off-diagonal or non-identity components after composition with their adjoint.
    This fix ensures that these small components are properly zeroed out
    according to the specified tolerances, leading to accurate determination
    of unitarity.
