    The Quantum Shannon Decomposition (:func:`.qs_decomposition`) now includes an optimization that reduces
    the :class:`.CXGate` count in the case that the input unitary is a controlled unitary.

    The :meth:`.UnitaryGate.control` method now internally uses
    :func:`.qs_decomposition` instead of :class:`.Isometry` for the
    decomposition used to define the controlled :class:`.UnitaryGate`. This
    change reduces the number of :class:`.CXGate` used in the
    :attr:`~.ControlledGate.definition` for the returned :class:`.ControlledGate`
    by approximately 2x.
