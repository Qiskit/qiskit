    The Quantum Shannon Decomposition (:func:`.qs_decomposition`) now includes an optimization that reduces
    the :class:`.CXGate` count in the case that the input unitary is a controlled unitary.

    The :meth:`.UnitaryGate.control` method now uses :func:`.qs_decomposition` instead of :class:`.Isometry` for decomposition.
    This change reduces the number of :class:`.CXGate` by approximately 2x.
