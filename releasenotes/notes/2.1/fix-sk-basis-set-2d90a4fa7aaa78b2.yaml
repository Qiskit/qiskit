    Fixed a problem in the :class:`.SolovayKitaevSynthesis` unitary synthesis plugin,
    where repeatedly running the plugin with different basis gates incorrectly reused the 
    basis gates from the first run only. The problem was due to ignoring the basis gates 
    when caching basic approximations, and is now fixed.
