    The circuit returned by the :func:`.excitation_preserving` function
    and :class:`.ExcitationPreserving` class now are built using a single
    :class:`.XXPlusYYGate`. This is a change from previous releases that
    used an :class:`.RXXGate` followed by an :class:`.RYYGate`. This new
    circuit construction is equivalent but uses fewer gates that are
    all excitation preserving by definition simpler.
