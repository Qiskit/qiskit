    Added a new optional extra dependency target ``qpy-compat``. This
    target should be used if you plan to load :mod:`.qpy` files using older
    QPY formats. The target installs extra requirements used for loading QPY
    files using format versions < 13. If you are only using newer QPY format
    versions you do no need to install this. The :func:`.qpy.dump` only
    generates QPY >=13 this is only needed for loading files generated with
    older (older than 2.0.0) Qiskit releases You can install this new optional
    variant with ``pip install qiskit[qpy-compat]``.

    Qiskit now uses its own, Rust-based symbolic expression library to implement
    the internals of :class:`.ParameterExpression` and :class:`.Parameter`. As this is
    a new implementation of the core symbolic math engine used for
    :class:`.ParameterExpression` there might be minor differences in
    the exact behavior of some functionality. It should always produce
    equivalent results for the documented API. Please open an issue if there
    are any problems with correctness found.

    The dependency on ``symengine`` which was used for building :class:`.ParameterExpression`
    objects has been removed. It has been replaced by a internal symbolic engine and is no
    longer required for core functionality in Qiskit. The only exception is that symengine
    was embedded into QPY formats 10, 11, and 12 so it is still required if you are
    deserializing those formats. The dependency on symengine for :func:`.qpy.load` was made
    explicitly optional in 2.0.0, but if you were previously relying on symengine getting
    installed by default for this functionality you will now need to manually install it
    to load the payload.
