    Fixed a bug in the :class:`.PauliEvolutionSynthesisDefault` and :class:`.PauliEvolutionSynthesisRustiq` plugins that 
    modified the `.synthesis` attribute of the original circuit when setting ``preserve_order=False``. The behavior of the
    plugins has been restored and the original circuit is now preserved throughout the transpilation pipeline.
