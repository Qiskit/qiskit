    Fixed the :attr:`~.OrGate.name` attribute of the :class:`.OrGate`, that was
    previously incorrectly set to the string ``"and"`` instead of the expected
    value ``"or"`` which is now returned. This incorrect value ``"and"`` conflicted
    with the :attr:`.AndGate.name` and could have possibly led to several problems
    around using the :class:`.Orgate` and differentiating it from an
    :class:`.AndGate`.
