    Fixed an issue with the :meth:`.Statevector.probabilities_dict` and :meth:`.DensityMatrix.probabilities_dict`
    method where it would return incorrect results for non-qubit systems when the ``qargs`` argument was
    specified.
    Fixed `#9210 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/9210>`__
