    Additional documentation has been added to
    :method:`~.pulse.library.ParametricPulse.validate_parameters`
    which clarifies that this method serves only as an internal check for subclasses
    and should not be interpreted or used as a part of the user-facing API. Refer to
    `#7882 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/7882>` for more details.
