    Adds new layout and routing methods based on paper
    `Time-optimal Qubit mapping` <https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3445814.3446706>`__
    to :func:`~qiskit.compiler.transpile`. To use them, optional package
    `Qiskit TOQM <https://github.com/qiskit-toqm/qiskit-toqm>`__ must be
    installed. The ``layout_method`` and ``routing_method`` kwargs of 
    :func:`~qiskit.compiler.transpile` support an additional value, ``'toqm'``
    which is used to enable layout and or routing via TOQM.
