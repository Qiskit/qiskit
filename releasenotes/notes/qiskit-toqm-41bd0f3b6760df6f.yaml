    Adds a new layout and routing method based on paper
    `Time-optimal Qubit mapping` <https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3445814.3446706>`__
    to :func:`~qiskit.compiler.transpile`. To use it, optional package
    `Qiskit TOQM <https://github.com/qiskit-toqm/qiskit-toqm>`__ must be
    installed. The ``routing_method`` kwarg of 
    :func:`~qiskit.compiler.transpile` supports an additional value, ``'toqm'``
    which is used to enable layout and routing via TOQM.

    To install ``qiskit-toqm`` along with Terra, run:

    .. code-block::

       pip install qiskit-terra[toqm]
