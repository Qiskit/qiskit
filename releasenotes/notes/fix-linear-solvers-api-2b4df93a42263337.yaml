    The linear solvers package API documentation was incomplete. The subfolders
    :mod:`qiskit.algorithms.linear_solvers.matrices` and 
    :mod:`qiskit.algorithms.linear_solvers.observables`, 
    and all classes therein have now been added.
    Furthermore, the module-level documentation for linear solvers was
    generally improved.
