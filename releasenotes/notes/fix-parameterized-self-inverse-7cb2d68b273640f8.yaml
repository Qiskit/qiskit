    Fixed an issue with the :class:`~.InverseCancellation` pass where it would
    incorrectly cancel gates passed in as self inverses with a parameter
    value, if a run of gates had a different parameter value. For example::

        from math import pi

        from qiskit.circuit.library import RZGate
        from qiskit.circuit import QuantumCircuit
        from qiskit.transpiler.passes import InverseCancellation

        inverse_pass = InverseCancellation([RZGate(0)])

        qc = QuantumCircuit(1)
        qc.rz(0, 0)
        qc.rz(pi, 0)

        inverse_pass(qc)

    would previously have incorrectly cancelled the two rz gates.
