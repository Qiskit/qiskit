upgrade_circuits:
  - |
    The deprecated ``.duration`` and ``.unit`` attributes for the
    :class:`.QuantumCircuit` class have been removed. These attributes
    were used to track the estimated duration and unit of that duration
    to execute on the circuit. However, the values of these attributes
    were always limited, as they would only be properly populated if the
    transpiler were run with the correct settings. The duration was also
    only a guess based on the longest path on the sum of instruction
    durations and wouldn’t ever correctly account for control flow or
    conditionals in the circuit. If you need to compute an estimate of
    the duration of a circuit you can use the
    :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.estimate_duration` method which does a similar
    calculation but makes the fact that it's an estimate explicit.
