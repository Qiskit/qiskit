upgrade_circuits:
  - |
    The deprecated attributes for :class:`.Instruction` and :class:`.Gate`: ``duration`` and ``unit``.

  - |
    The deprecated attribute for :class:`.Instruction` and :class:`.Gate`: ``condition`` has been
    removed
  - |
    The deprecated methods for :class:`.Instruction` and :class:`.Gate`: ``c_if`` and ``condition_bits``
    have been removed.
  - |
    The deprecated methods ``InstructionSet.c_if`` has been removed.
upgrade_transpiler:
  - |
    The :class:`.ResetAfterMeasureSimplification` transpiler pass now will use an :class:`.IfElseOp`
    to condition the execution of the :class:`.XGate` instead of setting a ``condition`` attribute
    on the gate. This is because the ``condition`` attribute has been removed from the Qiskit data model.
  - |
    The deprecated ``ConvertConditionsToIfOps`` transpiler pass has been removed. The underlying
    ``condition`` attribute of :class:`.Instruction` class has been removed so this transpiler pass
    no longer had anything to convert from. Instead you should directly use :class:`.IfElseOp` to
    classically condition the execution of an operation.
