features_transpiler:
  - |
    The scheduling passes :class:`.PadDelay` and :class:`.PadDynamicalDecoupling` has new arguments on
    their constructors ``target`` and ``durations``.
upgrade_circuits:
  - |
    The deprecated attributes for :class:`.Instruction` and :class:`.Gate`: ``duration`` and ``unit``.

  - |
    The deprecated attribute for :class:`.Instruction` and :class:`.Gate`: ``condition`` has been
    removed
  - |
    The deprecated methods for :class:`.Instruction` and :class:`.Gate`: ``c_if`` and ``condition_bits``
    have been removed.
  - |
    The deprecated methods ``InstructionSet.c_if`` has been removed.
upgrade_transpiler:
  - |
    The :class:`.ResetAfterMeasureSimplification` transpiler pass now will use an :class:`.IfElseOp`
    to condition the execution of the :class:`.XGate` instead of setting a ``condition`` attribute
    on the gate. This is because the ``condition`` attribute has been removed from the Qiskit data model.
  - |
    The deprecated ``ConvertConditionsToIfOps`` transpiler pass has been removed. The underlying
    ``condition`` attribute of :class:`.Instruction` class has been removed so this transpiler pass
    no longer had anything to convert from. Instead you should directly use :class:`.IfElseOp` to
    classically condition the execution of an operation.
  - |
    The :class:`.PadDelay` and :class:`.PadDynamicalDecoupling` transpiler passes now require a new
    argument when constructed. Either ``target`` or ``durations`` need to be specified with a
    :class:`.Target` or :class:`.InstructionDurations` respectively. Without these the passes will
    not be able to determine the duration of instructions in the circuit and will error. Previously
    these passes would determine these values from the now removed ``duration`` attribute of
    :class:`.Instruction` objects.
  - |
    The previously deprecated argument ``propagate_condition`` on the :class:`.DAGCircuit` methods
    :meth:`~.DAGCircuit.substitute_node_with_dag` and :meth:`~.DAGCircuit.substitute_node` has been
    removed. These arguments were deprecated in Qiskit 1.4.0 and were removed because the larger
    removal of ``Instruction.condition`` it no longer served a purpose.
