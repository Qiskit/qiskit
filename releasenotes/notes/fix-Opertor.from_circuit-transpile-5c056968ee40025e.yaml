    The ``._layout`` attribute of the :class:`~.QuantumCircuit` object has
    been changed from storing a :class:`~.Layout` object to containing a
    tuple of a :class:`~.Layout` object and a dictionary mapping qubits
    to position indices. This change was necessary to provide all
    the information for a post-transpiled circuit to be able to fully
    reverse the permutation caused by initial layout in all situations. While
    this attribute is private and shouldn't be used externally, it is
    the only way to track the initial layout through :func:`~.transpile`
    so the change is being documented in case you're relying on it. If
    you have a use case for the ``_layout`` attribute that is not being
    addressed by the Qiskit API please open an issue so we can address this
    feature gap.
fixes:
  - |
    The :meth:`.Operator.from_circuit` constructor method has been updated
    so that it can handle the layout output from :func:`~.transpile` and
    correctly reverse the qubit permutation caused by layout in all cases.
    Previously, if your transpiled circuit used loose :class:`~.Qubit` objects,
    multiple :class:`~.QuantumRegister` objects, or a single
    :class:`~.QuantumRegister` with a name other than ``"q"`` the constructor
    would have failed to create an :class:`~.Operator` from the circuit.
    Fixed `#8800 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/8800>`__.
