    Fixed :mod:`~qiskit.circuit.qpy_serialization` support for
    serializing :class:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit` objects that are
    using :class:`.ParameterVector` or :class:`.ParameterVectorElement` as
    parameters. Previously, a :class:`.ParameterVectorElement` parameter was
    just treated as a :class:`.Parameter` for QPY serialization which meant
    the :class:`.ParameterVector` context was lost in QPY and the output
    order of :attr:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.parameters` could be
    incorrect.

    To fix this issue a new QPY format version, :ref:`version_3`, was required.
    This new format version includes a representation of the
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.ParameterVectorElement` class which is
    described in the :mod:`~qiskit.circuit.qpy_serialization` documentation at
    :ref:`param_vector`.
