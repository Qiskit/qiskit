    Open controls were implemented by modifying a gate\'s 
    definition. However, when the gate already exists in the basis,
    this definition is not used, which yields incorrect circuits sent
    to a backend. This modifies the unroller to output the definition
    if it encounters a controlled gate with open controls.
