    Added a new parameter, `add_bits`, to `measure_all`. By default it's set
    to True, which means it behaves just like it used to, adding a new
    ClassicalRegister with the same size as the number of qubits to store the
    measurements. If set to False, the measurements will be stored in the
    already existing classical bits unless the number of qubits is bigger than
    the number of bits, in which case it will raise a CircuitError. The
    corresponding documentation and tests have been added too.
