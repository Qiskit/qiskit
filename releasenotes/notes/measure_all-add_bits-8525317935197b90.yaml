    Added a new parameter, ``add_bits``, to :obj:`.QuantumCircuit.measure_all`.
    By default it is set to ``True`` to maintain the previous behaviour of adding a new :obj:`.ClassicalRegister` of the same size as the number of qubits to store the measurements.
    If set to ``False``, the measurements will be stored in the already existing classical bits.
    See `#7305 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/pull/7305>`__.
