    `seaborn`_ is now a dependency for the function
    ``qiskit.visualization.plot_state_qsphere()``. It is needed to generate
    proper angular color maps for the visualization. The
    ``qiskit-terra[visualization]`` extras install target has been updated to
    install ``seaborn>=0.9.0`` If you are using visualizations and specifically
    the ``plot_state_qsphere()`` function you can use that to install
    ``seaborn`` or just manually run ``pip install seaborn>=0.9.0``

    The ``qiskit.visualization.plost_state_qsphere()`` has been updated to fix
    several issues with it. Now output Q Sphere visualization will be correctly
    generated and the following aspects have been updated:

     * All complementary basis states are antipodal
     * Phase is indicated by color of line and marker on sphere's surface
     * Probability is indicated by translucency of line and volume of marker on
       sphere's surface
