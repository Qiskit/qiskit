    The 0.9 release includes many new features and many bug fixes. The biggest
    changes for this release are new debugging capabilities for PassManagers.
    This includes a function to visualize a PassManager, the ability to add
    a callback function to a PassManager, and logging of passes run in the
    PassManager. Additionally, this release standardizes the way that
    you can set an initial layout for your circuit. So now you can leverage
    ``initial_layout`` the kwarg parameter on ``qiskit.compiler.transpile()``
    and ``qiskit.execute()`` and the qubits in the circuit will get laid
    out on the desire qubits on the device. Visualization of circuits will
    now also show this clearly when visualizing a circuit that has been
    transpiled with a layout.
features:
  - |
    A new analysis pass ``CountOpsLongest`` was added to retrieve the number
    of operations on the longest path of the DAGCircuit. When used it will
    add a ``count_ops_longest_path`` key to the property set dictionary.
    You can add it to your a passmanager with something like::

        from qiskit.transpiler.passes import CountOpsLongestPath
        from qiskit.transpiler.passes import CxCancellation
        from qiskit.transpiler import PassManager

        pm = PassManager()
        pm.append(CountOpsLongestPath())

    and then access the longest path via the property set value with something
    like::

        pm.append(
            CxCancellation(),
            condition=lambda property_set: property_set[
                'count_ops_longest_path'] < 5)

    which will set a condition on that pass based on the longest path.
  - |
    Two new functions, ``sech()`` and ``sech_deriv()`` were added to the pulse
    library module ``qiskit.pulse.pulse_lib`` for creating an unnormalized
    hyperbolic secant ``SamplePulse`` object and an unnormalized hyperbolic
    secant derivative ``SamplePulse`` object respectively.
  - |
    A new kwarg option ``vertical_compression`` was added to the
    ``QuantumCircuit.draw()`` method and the
    ``qiskit.visualization.circuit_drawer()`` function. This option only works
    with the ``text`` backend. This option can be set to either ``high``,
    ``medium`` (the default), or ``low`` to adjust how much vertical space is
    used by the output visualization.
  - |
    A new kwarg boolean option ``idle_wires`` was added to the
    ``QuantumCircuit.draw()`` method and the
    ``qiskit.visualization.circuit_drawer()`` function. It works for all drawer
    backends. When ``idle_wires`` is set False in a drawer call the drawer will
    not draw any bits that do not have any circuit elements in the output
    quantum circuit visualization.
  - |
    A new PassManager visualizer function
    ``qiskit.visualization.pass_mamanger_drawer()`` was added. This function
    takes in a PassManager object and will generate a flow control diagram
    of all the passes run in the PassManager.
  - |
    When creating a PassManager you can now specify a callback function that
    if specified will be run after each pass is executed. This function gets
    passed a set of kwargs on each call with the state of the pass manager after
    each pass execution. Currently these kwargs are:

     * pass\_ (Pass): the pass being run
     * dag (DAGCircuit): the dag output of the pass
     * time (float): the time to execute the pass
     * property_set (PropertySet): the property set
     * count (int): the index for the pass execution

    However, it's worth noting that while these arguments are set for the 0.9
    release they expose the internals of the pass manager and are subject to
    change in future release.

    For example you can use this to create a callback function that will
    visualize the circuit output after each pass is executed::

        from qiskit.transpiler import PassManager

        def my_callback(**kwargs):
            print(kwargs['dag'])

        pm = PassManager(callback=my_callback)

    Additionally you can specify the callback function when using
    ``qiskit.compiler.transpile()``::

        from qiskit.compiler import transpile

        def my_callback(**kwargs):
            print(kwargs['pass'])

        transpile(circ, callback=my_callback)
  - |
    A new method ``filter()`` was added to the ``qiskit.pulse.Schedule`` class.
    This enables filtering the instructions in a schedule. For example,
    filtering by instruction type::

        from qiskit.pulse import Schedule
        from qiskit.pulse.commands import Acquire
        from qiskit.pulse.commands import AcquireInstruction
        from qiskit.pulse.commands import FrameChange

        sched = Schedule(name='MyExperiment')
        sched.insert(0, FrameChange(phase=-1.57)(device))
        sched.insert(60, Acquire(5))
        acquire_sched = sched.filter(instruction_types=[AcquireInstruction])

    Additional decomposition methods for several types of gates. These methods
    will use different decomposition techniques to break down a gate into
    a sequence of CNOTs and single qubit gates. The following methods are
    added:

    +--------------------------------+---------------------------------------+
    | Method                         | Description                           |

    |                                | qubits (m=n) or to prepare any state  |
    |                                | of n qubits (m=0)                     |

    |                                | into three rotation gates and add to  |
    |                                | a circuit                             |
    +--------------------------------+---------------------------------------+
    | ``QuantumCircuit.ucg()``       | Attach an uniformly controlled gate   |
    |                                | (also called a multiplexed gate) to a |
    |                                | circuit                               |
    +--------------------------------+---------------------------------------+
    | ``QuantumCircuit.ucx()``       | Attach a uniformly controlled (also   |
    |                                | called multiplexed) Rx rotation gate  |
    |                                | to a circuit                          |
    +--------------------------------+---------------------------------------+
    | ``QuantumCircuit.ucy()``       | Attach a uniformly controlled (also   |
    |                                | called multiplexed) Ry rotation gate  |
    |                                | to a circuit                          |
    +--------------------------------+---------------------------------------+
    | ``QuantumCircuit.ucz()``       | Attach a uniformly controlled (also   |
    |                                | called multiplexed) Rz rotation gate  |
    |                                | to a circuit                          |
    +--------------------------------+---------------------------------------+

    Addition of Gray-Synth and Patel–Markov–Hayes algorithms for
    synthesis of CNOT-Phase and CNOT-only linear circuits. These functions
    allow the synthesis of circuits that consist of only CNOT gates given
    a linear function or a circuit that consists of only CNOT and phase gates
    given a matrix description.
  - |
    A new function ``random_circuit`` was added to the
    ``qiskit.circuit.random`` module. This function will generate a random
    circuit of a specified size by randomly selecting different gates and
    adding them to the circuit. For example, you can use this to generate a
    5 qubit circuit with a depth of 10 using::

        from qiskit.circuit.random import random_circuit

        circ = random_circuit(5, 10)
  - |
    A new kwarg ``output_names`` was added to the
    ``qiskit.compiler.transpile()`` function. This kwarg takes in a string
    or a list of strings and uses those as the value of the circuit name for
    the output circuits that get returned by the ``transpile()`` call. For
    example::

        from qiskit.compiler import transpile
        my_circs = [circ_a, circ_b]
        tcirc_a, tcirc_b = transpile(my_circs,
                                     output_names=['Circuit A', 'Circuit B'])

    the ``name`` attribute on tcirc_a and tcirc_b will be ``'Circuit A'`` and
    ``'Circuit B'`` respectively.
  - |
    A new method ``equiv()`` was added to the ``qiskit.quantum_info.Operator``
    and ``qiskit.quantum_info.Statevector`` classes. These methods are used
    to check whether a second ``Operator`` object or ``Statevector`` is
    equivalent up to global phase.

fixes:
  - |
    Support for n-qubit unitaries was added to the BasicAer simulator and
    ``unitary`` (arbitrary unitary gates) was added to the set of basis gates
    for the simulators
other:

    Calls to ``PassManager.run()`` now will emit python logging messages at the
    INFO level for each pass execution. These messages will include the Pass
    name and the total execution time of the pass. Python's standard logging
    was used because it allows Qiskit-Terra's logging to integrate in a standard
    way with other applications and libraries. All logging for the transpiler
    occurs under the ``qiskit.transpiler`` namespace, as used by
    ``logging.getLogger('qiskit.transpiler``). For example, to turn on DEBUG
    level logging for the transpiler you can run::

        import logging

        logging.basicConfig()
        logging.getLogger('qiskit.transpiler').setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

    which will set the log level for the transpiler to DEBUG and configure
    those messages to be printed to stderr.
