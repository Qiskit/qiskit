    The ``CompositeGate`` class has been removed. Instead you should
    directly create a instruction object from a circuit and append that to your
    circuit. For example, you can run something like::

        custom_gate_circ = qiskit.QuantumCircuit(2)
        custom_gate_circ.x(1)
        custom_gate_circ.h(0)
        custom_gate_circ.cx(0, 1)
        custom_gate = custom_gate_circ.to_instruction()
