    Introduced a new pulse command ``Delay`` which may be inserted into a pulse
    ``Schedule``. This command accepts a ``duration`` and may be added to any
    ``Channel``. Other commands may not be scheduled on a channel during a delay.

    The delay can be added just like any other pulse command. For example::

      from qiskit import pulse

      drive_channel = pulse.DriveChannel(0)
      delay = pulse.Delay(20)

      sched = pulse.Schedule()
      sched += delay(drive_channel)
