deprecations:
  - |
    The ``u0`` gate has been deprecated in favor of using multiple ``iden``
    gates and it will be removed in the future. If you're using the ``u0`` gate
    in your circuit you should update your calls to use ``iden``. For example,
    f you were using ``circuit.u0(2)`` in your circuit before that should be
    updated to be::

        circuit.iden()
        circuit.iden()

    instead.
