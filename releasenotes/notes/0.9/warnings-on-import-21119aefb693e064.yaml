    The root of the ``qiskit`` namespace will now emit a warning on import if
    either ``qiskit.IBMQ`` or ``qiskit.Aer`` could not be setup. This will
    occur whenever anything in the ``qiskit`` namespace is imported. These
    warnings were added to make it clear for users up front if they're running
    qiskit and the qiskit-aer and qiskit-ibmq-provider packages could not be
    found. It's not always clear if the packages are missing or python
    packaging/pip installed an element incorrectly until you go to use them and
    get an empty ``ImportError``. These warnings should make it clear up front
    if there these commonly used aliases are missing.

    However, for users that choose not to use either qiskit-aer or
    qiskit-ibmq-provider this might cause additional noise. For these users
    these warnings are easily suppressable using Python's standard library
    ``warnings``. Users can suppress the warnings by putting thse two lines
    before any imports from qiskit::

        import warnings
        warnings.filterwarnings('ignore', category=RuntimeWarning,
                                module='qiskit')

    This will suppress the warnings emitted by not having qiskit-aer or
    qiskit-ibmq-provider installed, but still preserve any other warnings
    emitted by qiskit or any other package.
