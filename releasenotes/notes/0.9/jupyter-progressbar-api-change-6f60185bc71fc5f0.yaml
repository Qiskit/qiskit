    The jupyter cell magic ``%%qiskit_progress_bar`` from
    ``qiskit.tools.jupyter`` has been changed to a line magic. This was done
    to better reflect how the magic is used and how it works. If you were using
    the ``%%qiskit_progress_bar`` cell magic in an existing notebook, you will
    have to update this to be a line magic by changing it to be
    ``%qiskit_progress_bar`` instead. Everything else should behave
    identically.
