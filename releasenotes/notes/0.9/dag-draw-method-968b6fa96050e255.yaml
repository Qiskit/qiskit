    A ``DAGCircuit`` object (i.e. the graph representation of a QuantumCircuit where
    operation dependencies are explicit) can now be visualized with the ``.draw()``
    method. This is in line with Qiskit's philosophy of easy visualization.
    Other objects which support a ``.draw()`` method are ``QuantumCircuit``,
    ``PassManager``, and ``Schedule``.
