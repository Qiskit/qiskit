    The :meth:`~qiskit.circuit.Register.name` setter method of class
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.Register` previously did not check the assigned
    string to be a valid register name as per the  
    `OpenQASM specification <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.03429v2.pdf>`_. 
    This check is performed when the name is specified in the constructor.
    With this update, this check is also now performed in the setter method

    The following code should now raise a CircuitError

    .. code-block::

       >>> from qiskit import QuantumRegister
       >>> q = QuantumRegister(1)
       >>> q.name = '_q'
