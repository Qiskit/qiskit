    The performance of :meth:`.SparsePauliOp.from_operator` has been optimized on top of the
    algorithm improvements methods introduced in Qiskit 1.0.  It is now approximately five times
    faster than before for fully dense matrices, taking approximately 40ms to decompose a 10q
    operator involving all Pauli terms.
