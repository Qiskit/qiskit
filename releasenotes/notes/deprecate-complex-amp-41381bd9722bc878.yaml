    Initializing a :class:`~qiskit.pulse.library.ScalableSymbolicPulse` with complex `amp` value is now deprecated.
    Particularly, the following pulses

      * :class:`~qiskit.pulse.library.Gaussian`
      * :class:`~qiskit.pulse.library.GaussianSquare`
      * :class:`~qiskit.pulse.library.Drag`
      * :class:`~qiskit.pulse.library.Constant`

    initialize a :class:`~qiskit.pulse.library.ScalableSymbolicPulse`, and therefore initializing them with complex
    `amp` is now deprecated.

    Instead, one should use two floats for the `amp` and `angle` parameters, where `amp` represents the
    magnitude of the complex amplitude, and `angle` represents the angle of the complex amplitude. i.e. the
    complex amplitude is given by `amp * exp(1j * angle)`.
