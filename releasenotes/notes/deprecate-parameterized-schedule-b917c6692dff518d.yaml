deprecations:
  - |
    The :py:class:`qiskit.pulse.schedule.ParameterizedSchedule` has been deprecated.
    User can directly parameterize pulse ``Schedule`` with circuit ``Parameter`` object.
    Now ``InstructionScheduleMap`` accepts only ``Schedule`` and python callback function
    as schedule generator. Refer to `#5333 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/5333>`
    for more details.
upgrade:
  - |
    Fake pulse backends :py:class:`qiskit.test.mock.FakeOpenPulse2Q` and
    :py:class:`qiskit.test.mock.FakeOpenPulse3Q` are updated to have realistic
    pulse sequence definition.
