    The :func:`.qpy.load` function can now emit a
    :class:`.MissingOptionalLibrary` exception if a QPY v10, v11, or v12
    payload is passed in that is using symengine symbolic expressions
    and symengine is not installed. In the Qiskit 1.x releases symengine was
    always guaranteed to be installed, but starting in 2.x this is no longer
    a hard requirement and may only be needed if you're deserializing a QPY
    file that was generated using symengine. Parsing these QPY payloads
    requires symengine (0.11.0 or 0.13.0) as it's usage is baked into the
    format specification for QPY v10, v11, and v12 so if the payload requires
    it there is no option but to install a compatible version of symengine.
