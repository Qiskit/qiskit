    The ``pauli_list`` kwarg of :func:`.pauli_basis` has been deprecated as
    :func:`.pauli_basis` now always returns a :class:`.PauliList`. This argument
    was removed prematurely from Qiskit Terra 0.22.0 which broke compatibility
    for users that were leveraging the ``pauli_list``argument. Now, the argument
    has been restored but will emit a ``DeprecationWarning`` when used. If used
    it has no effect because since Qiskit Terra 0.22.0 a :class:`~.PauliList` is
    always returned.
fixes:
  - |
    Fixed the premature removal of the ``pauli_list`` keyword argument of
    the :func:`.pauli_basis` function which broke existing code using the
    ``pauli_list=True`` future compatibility path on upgrade to Qiskit Terra
    0.22.0. This keyword argument has been added back to the function and is
    now deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
