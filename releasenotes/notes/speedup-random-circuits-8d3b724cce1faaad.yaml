features:
  - |
    Random-circuit generation with ``qiskit.circuit.random.random_circuit`` is
    now significantly faster for large circuits.
  - Random-circuit generation with ``qiskit.circuit.random.random_circuit`` will
    now output all "standard" gates in Qiskit's circuit library (:mod:`.circuit.library`).
    This includes two 4-qubit gates :class:`.C3SXGate` and :class:`.RC3XGate`, and the
    allowed values of ``max_operands`` have been expanded accordingly.
upgrade:
  - |
    The exact circuit returned by ``qiskit.circuit.random.random_circuit`` for a
    given seed has changed.  This is due to efficiency improvements in the
    internal random-number generation for the function.
