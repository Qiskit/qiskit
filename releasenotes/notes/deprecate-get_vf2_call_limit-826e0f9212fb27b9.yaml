deprecations:
  - |
    The function ``get_vf2_call_limit`` available via the module
    :mod:`qiskit.transpiler.preset_passmanagers.common` has been
    deprecated. This will likely affect very few users since this function was
    neither explicitly exported nor documented.  Its functionality has been
    replaced and extended by a function in the same module.
