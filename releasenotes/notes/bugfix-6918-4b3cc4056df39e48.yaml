    Fixed an issue causing an error when trying to compute a gradient with the
    :class:`~qiskit.opflow.gradients.CircuitGradient` class for a gate that was not
    a supported gate. This bugfix transpiles a given gate to the set of supported gates for
    a requested gradient method.
    Fixes `#6918 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/6918>`__.
