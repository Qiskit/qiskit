features:
  - |
    Added ``average_gate_fidelity`` and ``gate_error`` functions for
    ``qiskit.quantum_info`` operator and quantum channel objects.
issues:
  - |
    List known issues here, or remove this section.  All of the list items in
    this section are combined when the release notes are rendered, so the text
    needs to be worded so that it does not depend on any information only
    available in another section, such as the prelude. This may mean repeating
    some details.
upgrade:
  - |
    Changed second argument of ``process_fidelity`` function to be optional.
    If a target unitary is not specified, the process fidelity of the input
    channel with the identity operator will be returned.
deprecations:
  - |
    The ``require_cptp`` kwarg of the ``process_fidelity`` function has been
    deprecated. It is superseded by two separate kwargs ``require_cp`` and
    ``require_tp``.
