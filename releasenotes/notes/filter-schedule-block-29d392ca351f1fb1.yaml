    The method :meth:`~qiskit.pulse.schedule.ScheduleBlock.filter` is activated
    in the :class:`~qiskit.pulse.schedule.ScheduleBlock` class.
    This method enables users to retain only :class:`~qiskit.pulse.Instruction`
    objects which pass through all the provided filters.
    As builtin filter conditions, pulse :class:`~qiskit.pulse.channels.Channel` 
    subclass instance and :class:`~qiskit.pulse.instructions.Instruction` 
    subclass type can be specified.
    User-defined callbacks taking :class:`~qiskit.pulse.instructions.Instruction` instance 
    can be added to the filters, too.
