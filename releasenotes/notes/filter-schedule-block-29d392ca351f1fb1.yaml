    The method :meth:`~qiskit.pulse.schedule.ScheduleBlock.filter` is activated
    in the :class:`~qiskit.pulse.schedule.ScheduleBlock` class.
    This method enables users to retain only :class:`~qiskit.pulse.Instruction`
    objects which pass through all the provided filters.
    As the filters, :mod:`~qiskit.pulse.channels` modules and
    :mod:`~qiskit.pulse.instructions` modules can be specified.
    User-defined functions can be added to the filters, too.
