    Added the C API function :c:func:`qk_circuit_instruction_kind` for querying the kind of a specific
    instruction in a quantum circuit. This function returns a ``COperationKind`` enum value to identify
    the type of operation at a given index within the circuit.
    Added the C API function :c:func:`qk_circuit_inst_unitary` to extract the unitary matrix associated with a
    specific unitary instruction in a quantum circuit. This function populates a provided output array
    with the unitary matrix, enabling C callers to access the unitary transformations defined
    within the circuit.
