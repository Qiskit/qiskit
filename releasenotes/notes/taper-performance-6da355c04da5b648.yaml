    Fixed :meth:`.Z2Symmetries.taper` support for running on larger problems
    method. Previously, the :meth:`~.Z2Symmetries.taper` method would require
    a large amount of memory which would typically cause failures for
    larger problem. As a side effect of this fix the performance has
    significantly improved.
