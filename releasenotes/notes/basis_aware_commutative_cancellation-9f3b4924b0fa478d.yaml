    This makes it optionally possible to tell the
    :class:`qiskit.transpiler.passes.optimization.CommutativeCancellation`
    pass about target basis. Previously the pass would automatically
    replace consecutive gates which commute with ZGate with the
    U1Gate. Functionally the target basis is the union of the gates in
    the circuit and the target basis. If no variable z-rotation gate
    exists no commutative cancellation will occur. This change may
    lead to different behavior if using this pass without specifying a
    basis and supplying a circuit with no variable z-rotation gate so
    a basis gate should be explicitly supplied.
