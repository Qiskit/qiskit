    A new class, :class:`qiskit.result.Counts` has been added. This class
    is a subclass of ``dict`` and can be interacted with like any other
    dictionary. But, it includes helper methods and attributes for dealing
    with counts results from experiments and also handles post processing
    and formatting of binary strings at object initialization. A ``Counts``
    object can be created by passing a dictionary  of counts with the keys
    being hexademical strings of the form ``'0x4a'`` and the value is the
    number of shots. For example::

      from qiskit.result import Counts

      counts = Counts({"0x0': 1, '0x1', 3, '0x2': 1020})

    A ``Counts`` object can be treated as a dictionary of binary string keys
    like the output of :meth:`qiskit.result.Result.get_counts`.
