    A new :ref:`translation plugin stage <transpiler-preset-stage-translation>` is added, called
    ``"default"``.  In Qiskit 2.0, this is simply an alias for the previous default ``"translator"``.
    The underlying default algorithm may change over the course of the Qiskit 2.x series for some or
    all targets, but you can always set ``translation_method=="translator"`` explicitly to maintain
    the current behavior.

    The :ref:`translation plugin stage <transpiler-preset-stage-translation>` name ``default`` is
    now reserved for the Qiskit built-in plugin of the same name.
