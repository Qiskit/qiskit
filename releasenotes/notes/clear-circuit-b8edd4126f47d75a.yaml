features:
  - |
    Added a new method :py:meth:`.QuantumCircuit.clear` which is used to to erase all instructions
    from a QuantumCircuit. We clear both the data and the parameter table.
  - |
    Added a new method :py:meth:`QuantumCircuit.copy_empty_like` which is used to get a cleared copy of a
    :class:`~.QuantumCircuit` instnace. This is logically equivalent to `qc.copy().clear()` however, it is done
    avoiding a deepcopy of the original QuantumCircuit, and therefore it is more efficient. This functionality
    already implemented for :class:`~.DAGCircuit`, and retains all relevant circuit properties other than the
    instructions and associated parameters (e.g. registers, bits, name, metadata). Unlike the
    :meth:`.DAGCircuit.copy_empty_like` method, this new :class:`~.QuantumCircuit` method allows for
    an optional parameter to update the name of the copied circuit, mimicking ``qc.copy(name)``.
