    Added an option to normalize statevector inputs by setting the new argument
    ``normalize`` to ``True`` in the :class:`.StatePreparation` and :class:`~.extensions.Initialize`
    classes, and the :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.prepare_state` and :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.initialize`
    methods. By default, this new argument is ``False`` and, as before, an unnormalized statevector
    will raise an error.
