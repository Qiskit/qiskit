    The instructions :class:`.StatePreparation` and :class:`~.extensions.Initialize`,
    and their associated circuit methods :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.prepare_state` and :meth:`~.QuantumCircuit.initialize`,
    gained a keyword argument ``normalize``, which can be set to ``True`` to automatically normalize
    an array target.  By default this is ``False``, which retains the current behaviour of
    raising an exception when given non-normalized input.
