    Fixed an issue with the :func:`~.transpile` function when run with a
    :class:`~.BackendV2` based backend and setting the ``scheduling_method``
    keyword argument. Previously, the function would not correctly process
    the default durations of the instructions supported by the backend which
    would lead to an error.
