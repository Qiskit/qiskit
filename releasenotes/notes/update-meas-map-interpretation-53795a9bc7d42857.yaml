    The interpretation of the `meas_map` has historically been that any measurement of
    qubit ``i`` must be accompanied by a measurement of all qubits in the same subgroup as ``i``.
    However, the interpretation should now be that the qubits in that subgrouping may not be
    measured such that they partially overlap.
    For example:

    .. code-block:: python

        # Good
        meas_map = [[0, 1]]
        # Acquire a subset of [0, 1]
        sched = pulse.Schedule()
        sched = sched.append(pulse.Acquire(10, acq_q0))

        # Acquire 0 and 1 together (same start time, same duration)
        sched = pulse.Schedule()
        sched = sched.append(pulse.Acquire(10, acq_q0))
        sched = sched.append(pulse.Acquire(10, acq_q1))

        # Acquire 0 and 1 disjointly
        sched = pulse.Schedule()
        sched = sched.append(pulse.Acquire(10, acq_q0))
        sched = sched.append(pulse.Acquire(10, acq_q1)) << 10

        # Acquisitions overlap, but 0 and 1 aren't in the same measurement grouping
        meas_map = [[0], [1]]
        sched = pulse.Schedule()
        sched = sched.append(pulse.Acquire(10, acq_q0))
        sched = sched.append(pulse.Acquire(10, acq_q1)) << 1

        # Bad: 0 and 1 are in the same grouping, but acquisitions overlap imperfectly
        meas_map = [[0, 1]]
        sched = pulse.Schedule()
        sched = sched.append(pulse.Acquire(10, acq_q0))
        sched = sched.append(pulse.Acquire(10, acq_q1)) << 1
