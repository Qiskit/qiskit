    :class:`.VF2Layout` now tracks partial candidate-layout scores during subgraph isomorphism
    matching.  This has no meaningful effect when there is no perfect layout to find, but can
    drastically reduce the cost of scoring layouts to choose the best candidate in high-symmetry
    cases.

    While the interface to :class:`.VF2Layout` remains logically the same, the ``max_trials``
    argument now has much less effect as a runtime limiter, other than when set to the value ``1``.
    This is because, with the new on-the-fly score-and-prune algorithm used internally by the class,
    "complete" layouts are encountered far more rarely, and the count of "trials" only increments
    when a new layout is encountered that is better in error rate than a previous one.  You should
    instead use ``call_limit`` as the deterministic runtime limiter; where ``max_trials`` measures
    complete layouts encountered, ``call_limit`` measures partial-layout extensions.
