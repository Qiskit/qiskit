    The user config file has 2 new configuration options, ``num_processes`` and
    ``parallel``, which are used to control the default behavior of
    :func:`~qiskit.tools.parallel_map`. The ``parallel`` option is a boolean
    that is used to dictate whether :func:`~qiskit.tools.parallel_map` will
    run in multiple processes or not. If it set to ``False`` calls to
    :func:`~qiskit.tools.parallel_map` will be executed serially, while setting
    it to ``True`` will enable parallel execution. The ``num_processes`` option
    takes an integer which sets how many CPUs to use when executing in parallel.
    By default it will use the number of CPU cores on a system.

    By default on macOS :func:`~qiskit.tools.parallel_map` will no longer run
    in multiple processes. This is a change from previous releases where the
    default behavior was that :func:`~qiskit.tools.parallel_map` would launch
    multiple processes. This change was made because with newer versions of
    macOS (especially with Python 3.8) multiprocessing is either unreliable
    or adds significant overhead because of the change in Python 3.8 to launch
    new processes with ``spawn`` instead of ``fork``. To re-enable parallel
    execution on macOS you can use the user config file ``parallel` option or
    set the environment variable ``QISKIT_PARALLEL`` to ``True``.
