features:
  - |
    Several lazy dependency checkers have been added to the new module
    :mod:`qiskit.utils.optionals`, which can be used to query if certain Qiskit
    functionality is available.  For example, you can ask if Qiskit has detected
    the presence of ``matplotlib`` by asking
    ``if qiskit.utils.optionals.HAS_MATPLOTLIB``.  These objects only attempt to
    import their dependencies when they are queried, so you can use them in
    runtime code without affecting import time.

    Import time for ``qiskit`` has been significantly improved, especially for
    those with many of Qiskit Terra's optional dependencies installed.
