    Introduced a new subclass :class:`~qiskit.pulse.library.ScalableSymbolicPulse`, as a
    sub class of :class:`~qiskit.pulse.library.SymbolicPulse`. The new subclass behaves
    the same way as :class:`~qiskit.pulse.library.SymbolicPulse`,
    except that it assumes that the envelope of the pulse includes a complex amplitude
    pre-factor of the form :math:`\text{amp}\times\exp\left(i\times\text{angle}\right)'.
    This envelope shape matches many common pulses, including all of the pulses in
    the Qiskit Pulse library (which were also converted to 'amp','angle' representation in
    this release).

    The new subclass removes the non-unique nature of the `amp`,`angle` representation,
    and correctly compares pulses according to their complex amplitude.

    QPY version was bumped to 6. Following the introduction of :class:`~qiskit.pulse.library.ScalableSymbolicPulse`
    the header of saved :class:`~qiskit.pulse.library.SymbolicPulse` objects was modified to include
    a `class_name` attribute, and the QPY version was bumped to reflect this.
