    Added a circuit implementing a quadratic form on binary variables.
    The circuit implements the operation 
    :math:`|x\rangle |0\rangle \mapsto |x\rangle |Q(x) \mod 2^m\rangle` 
    for the quadratic form :math:`Q` and :math:`m` output qubits.
    The quadratic form is specified using a matrix for the quadratic 
    terms, a vector for the linear terms and a constant offset.
