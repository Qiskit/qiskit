    A bug was fixed for when a generic gate is converted to a controlled
    version. Previously it was unrolled using u1,u3,cx gates before generating
    the controlled version for each of these gates. This caused simple operations
    to be decomposed to multiple controlled rx,ry,rz rotations. Currently gates is
    unrolled using:
      'x', 'y', 'z', 'h', 'rx', 'ry', 'swap', 'ccx', 'u1', 'u3', 'cx'
    This allows more compact decomposition
