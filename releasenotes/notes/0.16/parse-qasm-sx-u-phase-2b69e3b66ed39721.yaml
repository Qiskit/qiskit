    Fixed an error where loading a QASM file via
    :meth:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.from_qasm_file` or
    :meth:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.from_qasm_str` would fail
    if a ``u``, ``phase(p)``, ``sx``, or ``sxdg`` gate were present in
    the QASM file.
    Fixes `#5156 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/5151>`__
