    Fixes a bug where setting ``ctrl_state`` of a
    :class:`~qiskit.extensions.UnitaryGate` would be applied twice; once
    in the creation of the matrix for the controlled unitary and again
    when calling the :meth:`~qiskit.circuit.ControlledGate.definition` method of
    the :class:`qiskit.circuit.ControlledGate` class. This would give the
    appearance that setting ``ctrl_state`` had no effect.
