    Fixed a bug in the ``mpl`` output backend of the circuit drawer
    :meth:`qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.draw` and
    :func:`qiskit.visualization.circuit_drawer` that would
    cause the drawer to fail if the ``style`` kwarg was set to a string.
    The correct behavior would be to treat that string as a path to
    a JSON file containing the style sheet for the visualization. This has
    been fixed, and warnings are raised if the JSON file for the style
    sheet can't be loaded.
