    Previously the :func:`qiskit.execute.execute` function would incorrectly
    disallow both the ``backend`` and ``pass_manager`` kwargs to be
    specified at the same time. This has been fixed so that both
    ``backend`` and ``pass_manager`` can be used together on calls to
    :func:`~qiskit.execute.execute`.
    Fixes `#5037 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/5037>`__
