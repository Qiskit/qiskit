    The previously deprecated support for passing in a dictionary as the
    first positional argument to :class:`~qiskit.dagcircuit.DAGNode` constructor
    has been removed. Using a dictionary for the first positional argument
    was deprecated in the 0.13.0 release. To create a
    :class:`~qiskit.dagcircuit.DAGNode` object now you should directly
    pass the attributes as kwargs on the constructor.
