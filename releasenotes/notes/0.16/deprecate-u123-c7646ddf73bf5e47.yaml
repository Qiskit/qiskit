deprecations:
  - |
    The :class:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit` methods ``u1``, ``u2`` and
    ``u3`` are now deprecated. Instead the following replacements can be
    used.

    .. code-block::

        u1(theta) = p(theta) = u(0, 0, theta)
        u2(phi, lam) = u(pi/2, phi, lam) = p(pi/2 + phi) sx p(pi/2 lam)
        u3(theta, phi, lam) = u(theta, phi, lam) = p(phi + pi) sx p(theta + pi) sx p(lam)

    The gate classes themselves, :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.U1Gate`,
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.U2Gate` and :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.U3Gate`
    remain, to allow loading of old jobs.

upgrade:
  - |
    The :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.U3Gate` definition has been changed to
    be in terms of the :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.UGate` class. The
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.UGate` class has no definition. It is
    therefore not possible to unroll **every** circuit in terms of U3
    and CX anymore. Instead, U and CX can be used for **every** circuit.
