    Support for disassembly of :class:`~qiskit.qobj.PulseQobj` objects has
    been added to the :func:`qiskit.assembler.disassemble` function.
    For example:

    .. code-block::

      from qiskit import pulse
      from qiskit.assembler.disassemble import disassemble
      from qiskit.compiler.assemble import assemble
      from qiskit.test.mock import FakeOpenPulse2Q

      backend = FakeOpenPulse2Q()

      d0 = pulse.DriveChannel(0)
      d1 = pulse.DriveChannel(1)
      with pulse.build(backend) as sched:
          with pulse.align_right():
              pulse.play(pulse.library.Constant(10, 1.0), d0)
              pulse.shift_phase(3.11, d0)
              pulse.measure_all()

      qobj = assemble(sched, backend=backend, shots=512)
      scheds, run_config, header = disassemble(qobj)
