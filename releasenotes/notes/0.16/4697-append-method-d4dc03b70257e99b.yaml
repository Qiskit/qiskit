fixes:
  - |
    The :class:`qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit` method
    :meth:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.append` can now be used to insert one
    parameterized gate instance into multiple circuits. This fixes a previous
    issue where inserting a single parameterized
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.Gate` object into multiple circuits would
    cause failures when one circuit had a parameter assigned.
    Fixes `#4697 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/4697>`__
upgrade:
  - |
    Inserting a parameterized :class:`~qiskit.circuit.Gate` instance into
    a :class:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit` now creates a copy of that
    gate which is used in the circuit. If changes are made to the instance
    inserted into the circuit it will no longer be reflected in the gate in
    the circuit. This change was made to fix an issue when inserting a single
    parameterized :class:`~qiskit.circuit.Gate` object into multiple circuits.
