    Two alignment contexts are added to the pulse builder
    (:mod:`qiskit.pulse.builder`) to facilitate writing a repeated pulse
    sequence with delays.

    * :func:`qiskit.pulse.builder.align_equispaced` inserts delays with
      equivalent length in between pulse schedules within the context.
    * :func:`qiskit.pulse.builder.align_func` offers more advanced control of
      pulse position. This context takes a callable that calculates a fractional
      coordinate of i-th pulse and aligns pulses within the context. This makes
      coding of dynamical decoupling easy.
