    Previously the :class:`~qiskit.circuit.ControlledGate` method
    :meth:`~qiskit.circuit.ControlledGate.inverse` would not preserve the
    ``ctrl_state`` parameter in some cases. This has been fixed so that
    calling :meth:`~qiskit.circuit.ControlledGate.inverse` will preserve
    the value ``ctrl_state`` in its output.
