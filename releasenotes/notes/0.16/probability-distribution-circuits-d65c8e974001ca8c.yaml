    Several classes to load probability distributions into qubit amplitudes;
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.UniformDistribution`,
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.NormalDistribution`, and
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.LogNormalDistribution` were added to the
    circuit library (:mod:`qiskit.circuit.library`). The normal and
    log-normal distribution support both univariate and multivariate
    distributions. These circuits are central to applications in finance
    where quantum amplitude estimation is used.
