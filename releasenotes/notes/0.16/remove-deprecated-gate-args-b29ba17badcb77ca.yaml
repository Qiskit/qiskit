    The keyword arguments for the circuit gate methods (for example:
    :class:`qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.cx`) ``q``, ``ctl*``, and
    ``tgt*``, which were deprecated in the 0.12.0 release, have been removed.
    Instead, only  ``qubit``, ``control_qubit*`` and ``target_qubit*`` can be
    used as named arguments for these methods.
