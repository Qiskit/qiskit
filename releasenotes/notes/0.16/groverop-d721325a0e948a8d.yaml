    Added the :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.GroverOperator` to the circuit
    library (:mod:`qiskit.circuit.library`) to construct the Grover operator
    used in Grover's search algorithm and Quantum Amplitude
    Amplification/Estimation. Provided with an oracle in form of a circuit,
    ``GroverOperator`` creates the textbook Grover operator. To generalize
    this for amplitude amplification and use a generic operator instead of
    Hadamard gates as state preparation, the ``state_in`` argument can be
    used.
