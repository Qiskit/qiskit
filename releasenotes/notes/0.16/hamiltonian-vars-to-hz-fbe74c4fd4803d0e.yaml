    In the :class:`~qiskit.providers.models.PulseBackendConfiguration`
    in the ``hamiltonian`` attributes the ``vars`` field  is now returned
    in a unit of Hz instead of the previously used GHz. This change was made
    to be consistent with the units used with the other attributes in the
    class.
