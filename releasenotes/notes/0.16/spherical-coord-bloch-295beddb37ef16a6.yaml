    A new kwarg, ``coord_type`` has been added to
    :func:`qiskit.visualization.plot_bloch_vector`. This kwarg enables
    changing the coordinate system used for the input parameter that
    describes the positioning of the vector on the Bloch sphere in the
    generated visualization. There are 2 supported values for this new kwarg,
    ``'cartesian'`` (the default value) and ``'spherical'``. If the
    ``coord_type`` kwarg is set to ``'spherical'`` the list of parameters
    taken in are of the form ``[r, theta,  phi]`` where ``r`` is the
    radius, ``theta`` is the inclination from +z direction, and ``phi`` is
    the azimuth from +x direction. For example:
    
    .. jupyter-execute::

      from numpy import pi

      from qiskit.visualization import plot_bloch_vector

      x = 0
      y = 0
      z = 1
      r = 1
      theta = pi
      phi = 0


      # Cartesian coordinates, where (x,y,z) are cartesian coordinates
      # for bloch vector 
      plot_bloch_vector([x,y,z])

    .. jupyter-execute::

      plot_bloch_vector([x,y,z], coord_type="cartesian")  # Same as line above

    .. jupyter-execute::

      # Spherical coordinates, where (r,theta,phi) are spherical coordinates
      # for bloch vector
      plot_bloch_vector([r, theta, phi], coord_type="spherical")
