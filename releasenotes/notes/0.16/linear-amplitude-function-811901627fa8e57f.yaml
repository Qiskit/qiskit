    A new class :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.LinearAmplitudeFunction` was
    added to the circuit library (:mod:`qiskit.circuit.library`) for mapping
    (piecewise) linear functions on qubit amplitudes,

    .. math::

        F|x\rangle |0\rangle = \sqrt{1 - f(x)}|x\rangle |0\rangle + \sqrt{f(x)}|x\rangle |1\rangle
    
    
    The mapping is based on a controlled Pauli Y-rotations and 
    a Taylor approximation, as described in https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.06893. 
    This circuit can be used to compute expectation values of linear
    functions using the quantum amplitude estimation algorithm.
