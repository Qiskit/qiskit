    Previously, calling :meth:`~qiskit.circuit.library.BlueprintCircuit.inverse`
    on a :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.BlueprintCircuit` object
    could fail if its internal data property was not yet populated. This has
    been fixed so that the calling
    :meth:`~qiskit.circuit.library.BlueprintCircuit.inverse` will populate
    the internal data before generating the inverse of the circuit.
    Fixes `#5140 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/5140>`__
