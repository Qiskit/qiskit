    A new class :class:`qiskit.circuit.Delay` for representing a delay
    instruction in a circuit has been added. A new method
    :meth:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.delay` is now available for easily
    appending delays to circuits. This makes it possible to describe
    timing-sensitive experiments (e.g. T1/T2 experiment) in the circuit level.

    .. code-block::

        from qiskit import QuantumCircuit

        qc = QuantumCircuit(1, 1)
        qc.delay(500, 0, unit='ns')
        qc.measure(0, 0)

        qc.draw()

  - |
    A new argument ``scheduling_method`` for
    :func:`qiskit.compiler.transpile` has been added. It is required when
    transpiling circuits with delays.  If ``scheduling_method`` is specified,
    the transpiler returns a scheduled circuit such that all idle times in it
    are padded with delays (i.e. start time of each instruction is uniquely
    determined). This makes it possible to see how scheduled instructions
    (gates) look in the circuit level.

    .. code-block::

        from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, transpile
        from qiskit.test.mock.backends import FakeAthens

        qc = QuantumCircuit(2)
        qc.h(0)
        qc.cx(0, 1)

        scheduled_circuit = transpile(qc, backend=FakeAthens(), scheduling_method="alap", layout_method="trivial")
        print("Duration in dt:", scheduled_circuit.duration)
        scheduled_circuit.draw(idle_wires=False)

    See also :func:`~qiskit.visualization.timeline_drawer` for the best visualization
    of scheduled circuits.

  - |
    A new function :func:`qiskit.compiler.sequence` has been also added so that
    we can convert a scheduled circuit into a :class:`~qiskit.pulse.Schedule`
    to make it executable on a pulse-enabled backend.

    .. code-block:: python

        from qiskit.compiler import sequence

        sched = sequence(scheduled_circuit, pulse_enabled_backend)
  - |
    The :func:`~qiskit.compiler.schedule` has been updated so that it can
    schedule circuits with delays. Now there are two paths to schedule a
    circuit with delay:

    .. code-block:: python

        qc = QuantumCircuit(1, 1)
        qc.h(0)
        qc.delay(500, 0, unit='ns')
        qc.h(0)
        qc.measure(0, 0)

        sched_path1 = schedule(qc.decompose(), backend)
        sched_path2 = sequence(transpile(qc, backend, scheduling_method='alap'), backend)
        assert pad(sched_path1) == sched_path2

    Refer to the release notes and documentation for
    :func:`~qiskit.compiler.transpile` and :func:`~qiskit.compiler.sequence`
    for the details on the other path.
