upgrade:
  - |
    The previously deprecated module ``qiskit.extensions.standard`` has been
    removed. This module has been deprecated since the 0.14.0 release.
    The :mod:`qiskit.circuit.library` can be used instead.
    Additionally, all the gate classes previously in
    ``qiskit.extensions.standard`` are still importable from
    :mod:`qiskit.extensions`.
  - |
    The previously deprecated gates in the module
    ``qiskit.extensions.quantum_initializer``:
    ``DiagGate``, `UCG``, ``UCPauliRotGate``, ``UCRot``, ``UCRXGate``, ``UCX``,
    ``UCRYGate``, ``UCY``, ``UCRZGate``, ``UCZ`` have been removed. These were
    all deprecated in the 0.14.0 release and have alternatives available in
    the circuit library (:mod:`qiskit.circuit.library`).
  - |
    The previously deprecated :class:`qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit` gate method
    :meth:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.iden` has been removed. This was
    deprecated in the 0.13.0 release and
    :meth:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.i` or
    :meth:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.id` can be used instead.
