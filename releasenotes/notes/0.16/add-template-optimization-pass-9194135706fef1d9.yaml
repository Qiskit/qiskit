    A new optimization pass,
    :class:`qiskit.transpiler.passes.TemplateOptimization` has been added to
    the transpiler. This pass applies a template matching algorithm described
    in `arXiv:1909.05270 <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.05270.pdf>`__ that
    replaces all compatible maximal matches in the circuit.

    To implement this new transpiler pass a new module, ``template_circuits``,
    was added to the circuit library (:mod:`qiskit.circuit.library`). This new
    module contains all the Toffoli circuit templates used in the
    :class:`~qiskit.transpiler.passes.TemplateOptimization`.

    This new pass is **not** currently included in the preset pass managers
    (:mod:`qiskit.transpiler.preset_passmanagers`), to use it you will need
    to create a custom :class:`~qiskit.transpiler.PassManager`.
