features:
  - A new kwarg, ``inplace``, has been added to the function
    :func:`qiskit.result.marginal_counts`. This kwarg is used to control
    whether the contents are marginalized in place or a new copy is returned,
    for :class:`~qiskit.result.Result` object input. This parameter does not
    have any effect for an input ``dict`` or :class:`~qiskit.result.Counts`
    object.
upgrade:
  - |
    The function :func:`qiskit.result.marginal_counts` now, by default,
    does not modify the :class:`qiskit.result.Result` instance
    parameter. Previously, the ``Result`` object was always modified in place.
    A new kwarg ``inplace`` has been added
    :func:`~qiskit.result.marginal_counts` which enables using the previous
    behavior when ``inplace=True`` is set.
