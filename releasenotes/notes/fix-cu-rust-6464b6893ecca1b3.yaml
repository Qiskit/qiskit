    Fixed the definition of the :class:`.CUGate` matrix in Rust-space. 
    While this was not noticable while handling the :class:`.CUGate` purely on 
    Python side, this had knock-on effects when transpiler passes were using the 
    Rust representation, such as could happen in :class:`.Consolidate2qBlocks`.
    Fixed `#13118 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/13118>`__.
