    The :class:`~.SabreSwap` transpiler pass has a new keyword argument on its
    constructor, ``trials``. The ``trials`` argument is used to specify the
    number of random seed trials to attempt. The output from the
    `SABRE algorithm <https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.02573>`__  can differ greatly
    based on the seed used for the random number. :class:`~.SabreSwap` will
    now run the algorithm with ``trials`` number of random seeds and pick the
    best (with the fewest swaps inserted). If ``trials`` is not specified the
    pass will default to use the number of physical CPUs on the local system.
