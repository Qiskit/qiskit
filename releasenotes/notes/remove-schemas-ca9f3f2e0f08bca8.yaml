upgrade:
  - |
    The deprecated ``qiskit.schemas`` module and the ``qiskit.validation``
    module which build jsonschema validator from the schemas have been removed.
    This was deprecated in the 0.17.0 release and has been replaced with a
    dedicated repository for the IBM Quantum API payload schemas:

    https://github.com/Qiskit/ibm-quantum-schemas

    If you were relying on the schema files previously packaged in
    ``qiskit.schemas`` or the validators built on them you should use that
    repository and create validators from the schema files it contains.
  - |
    The functions ``qiskit.qobj.validate_qobj_against_schema`` and
    ``qiskit.qobj.common.validator`` along with the ``validate`` kwarg of
    the methods :meth:`qiskit.qobj.QasmQobj.to_dict`,
    :meth:`qiskit.qobj.PulseQobj.to_dict`, and :meth:`qiskit.qobj.Qobj.to_dict`
    have been removed. These were deprecated in the 0.17.0 release. If you were
    using these function you will have to manually build jsonschema validation
    functions for ``Qobj`` objects using the jsonschema files from:
    https://github.com/Qiskit/ibm-quantum-schemas
  - |
    The ``fastjsonschema`` and ``jsonschema`` are no longer in the requirements
    list for qiskit-terra. The internal use of jsonschema has been removed and
    they are no longer required to use qiskit-terra.
  - |
    The exception raised by the :func:`qiskit.compiler.assemble` function when
    invalid parameters are passed in for constructing a
    :class:`~qiskit.qobj.PulseQobj` have changed from a ``SchemaValidationError`
    to a :class:`qiskit.execeptions.QiskitError`. This was necessary because
    the ``SchemaValidationError`` class was removed along with the rest of
    the deprecated ``qiskit.schemas`` and ``qiskit.validation``. This also
    makes it more consistent with other error conditions from
    :func:`~qiskit.compiler.assemble` which were already raising a
    :class:`qiskit.execeptions.QiskitError`.
