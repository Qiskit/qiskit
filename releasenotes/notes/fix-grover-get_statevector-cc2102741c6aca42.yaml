    :class:`.Grover` amplification problems will no longer error when run on Aer
    simulators with Qiskit Aer versions 0.10 and above.  Previously the code::

        from qiskit import Aer
        from qiskit.algorithms import AmplificationProblem, Grover
        from qiskit.circuit.library import PhaseOracle

        backend = Aer.get_backend("aer_simulator_statevector")

        oracle = PhaseOracle("x1 & x2 & (not x3)")
        problem = AmplificationProblem(oracle, is_good_state=oracle.evaluate_bitstring)
        grover = Grover(quantum_instance=backend, iterations=2)
        result = grover.amplify(problem)

    would fail with::

        IndexError: index 0 is out of bounds for axis 0 with size 0

    but will now run as expected.
