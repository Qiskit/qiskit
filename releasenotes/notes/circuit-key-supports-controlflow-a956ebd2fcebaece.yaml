    Primitives may now support dynamic circuits with control flow, if the particular
    provider's implementation can support them.  Previously, the
    :class:`~BaseSampler` and :class:`~BaseEstimator` base classes could not correctly
    normalize such circuits.  This change does not automatically make all
    primitives support dynamic circuits, but it does make it possible for them
    to be supported by downstream providers.
