    The ``pass_manager`` kwarg for the :func:`qiskit.compiler.transpile`
    has been removed. It was originally deprecated in the 0.13.0 release.
    The preferred way to transpile a circuit with a custom
    :class:`~qiskit.transpiler.PassManager` object is to use the
    :meth:`~qiskit.transpiler.PassManager.run` method of the ``PassManager``
    object.
