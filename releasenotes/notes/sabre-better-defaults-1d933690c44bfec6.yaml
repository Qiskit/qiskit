    The relative weights of the "basic" and "lookahead" components of the :class:`.SabreSwap` and
    :class:`.SabreLayout` heuristics have been modified when extended-set tracking is active (as it
    always is in :class:`.SabreLayout`, and is by default in :class:`.SabreSwap`).  The heuristic
    component relating to the distance between qubits in an individual gate in the front layer now
    no longer weakens proportional to the number of gates in the front layer; this behavior was a
    historical choice, but at large circuit sizes, has the accidental effect of causing the front
    layer to be nearly ignored, which is disastrous for efficiency.

    The resulting routing improvements should be most noticeable for circuits that can frequently be
    stratified into layers of more than 20 parallel two-qubit gates.
