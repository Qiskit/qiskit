    Rich output from the :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.qasm` method (i.e. by setting ``formatted=True``)
    will now preferentially use the built-in IPython/Jupyter support for code blocks using a
    Pygments lexer with alias ``qasm2`` if it is available.  A suitable lexer can be installed by
    doing, for example:

    .. code-block:: text

      pip install openqasm-pygments

    In the future, the built-in Qiskit lexer and styles for OpenQASM 2 will be removed. If you are
    using them, you should plan to migrate to another package, such as the one mentioned above that
    is maintained by the OpenQASM community.
