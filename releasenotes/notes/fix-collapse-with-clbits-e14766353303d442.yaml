fixes:
  - |
    Fixed a bug in :class:`~BlockCollapser` where classical bits were ignored when collapsing
    a block of nodes.
  - |
    Fixed a bug in :meth:`~qiskit.dagcircuit.DAGCircuit.replace_block_with_op` and
    :meth:`~qiskit.dagcircuit.DAGDependency.replace_block_with_op`
    that led to ignoring classical bits.
