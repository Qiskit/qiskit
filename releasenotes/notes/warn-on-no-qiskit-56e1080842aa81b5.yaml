deprecations:
  - |
    The ``qiskit-terra`` python package is deprecated and will no longer receive
    updates starting in Qiskit 1.0.0. If you're installing ``qiskit-terra`` by
    itself this will no longer be updated for Qiskit>=1.0.0. If you're running
    qiskit without the ``qiskit`` package a ``FutureWarning`` will be emitted on
    import of :mod:`qiskit` to indicate you're not using the ``qiskit`` package.
critical:
  - |
    When updating Qiskit from ``0.46.x`` to ``1.0.0`` you will not be able to
    update in place. For example, ``pip install -U qiskit`` or
    ``pip install --upgrade qiskit`` is not supported and likely will **not**
    work. To upgrade qiskit the recommended path is to create a new virtual
    environment (:mod:`venv`) to build a new separate environment for
    Qiskit>=1.0.0. For example::

        python -m venv qiskit_1.0
        source qiskit_1.0/bin/activate
        pip install qiskit>=1

    will create a new virtual environment named ``qiskit_1.0`` will contain the
    new version of Qiskit.
