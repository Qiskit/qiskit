    The ``call_limit`` argument of :class:`.VF2Layout` and :class:`.VF2PostLayout` can now be a
    2-tuple, where the first item is used before the first match is found, then the limit swaps to
    the second after.  This is a more reliable runtime-limiter than the ``max_trials`` argument,
    now that layouts are scored on the fly with more aggressive pruning.
