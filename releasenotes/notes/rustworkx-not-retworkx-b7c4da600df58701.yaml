upgrade:
  - |
    The ``retworkx`` dependency for Qiskit has been removed and replaced by
    ``rustworkx`` library. These are the same packages, but ``rustworkx`` is
    the new name for ``retworkx`` which was renamed as part of their combined
    0.12.0 release. If you were previously using retworkx 0.12.0 with Qiskit
    then you already installed rustworkx (retworkx 0.12.0 was just a redirect
    shim for backwards compatibility). This change was made to migrate to the
    new package name which will be the only supported package in the future.
