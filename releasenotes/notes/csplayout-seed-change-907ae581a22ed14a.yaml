    The internal random number generator usage for the :class:`.CSPLayout` pass
    has been changed. This means that for a fixed seed the pass will potentially
    return different results from previous releases. The seed for seed results
    are not a guaranteed between releases for the :mod:`~qiskit.transpiler`
    but if you were relying on the exact results from this pass you can run the
    pass in an early release and use :mod:`~qiskit.qpy` to save the output and
    load it with the latest release.
