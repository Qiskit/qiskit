    Two transpiler passes have been added to ``qiskit.transpiler.passes.basis``.
    The first, ``UnrollCustomDefinitions``, unrolls all instructions in the
    circuit according to their ``.definition`` property, stopping when reaching
    either the specified ``basis_gates`` or a set of gates in the provided
    ``EquivalenceLibrary``. The second, ``BasisTranslator``, uses the set of
    translations in the provided ``EquivalenceLibrary`` to re-write circuit
    instructions in a specified basis.
