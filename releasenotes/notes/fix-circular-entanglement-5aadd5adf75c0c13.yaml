    Fixed a bug with the ``"circular"`` and ``"sca"`` entanglement for
    :class:`.NLocal` circuits and its derivatives. For entanglement blocks
    of more than 2 qubits, the circular entanglement was previously missing
    some connections. For example, for 4 qubits and a block size of 3 the
    code previously used::

      [(2, 3, 0), (0, 1, 2), (1, 2, 3)]

    but now is correctly adding the ``(3, 0, 1)`` connections, that is::

      [(2, 3, 0), (3, 0, 1), (0, 1, 2), (1, 2, 3)]

    As such, the ``"circular"`` and ``"sca"`` entanglements use ``num_qubits``
    entangling blocks per layer.
