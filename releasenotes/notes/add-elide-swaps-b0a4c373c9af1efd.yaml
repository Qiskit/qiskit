    Added a new optimization transpiler pass, :class:`~.ElidePermutations`,
    which is designed to run prior to the :ref:`layout_stage` and will
    optimize away any :class:`~.SwapGate`\s and
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.PermutationGate`\s
    in a circuit by permuting virtual
    qubits. For example, taking a circuit with :class:`~.SwapGate`\s:

    .. plot::

       from qiskit.circuit import QuantumCircuit

       qc = QuantumCircuit(3)
       qc.h(0)
       qc.swap(0, 1)
       qc.swap(2, 0)
       qc.cx(1, 0)
       qc.measure_all()
       qc.draw("mpl")

    will remove the swaps when the pass is run:

    .. plot::
       :include-source:

       from qiskit.transpiler.passes import ElidePermutations
       from qiskit.circuit import QuantumCircuit

       qc = QuantumCircuit(3)
       qc.h(0)
       qc.swap(0, 1)
       qc.swap(2, 0)
       qc.cx(1, 0)
       qc.measure_all()

       ElidePermutations()(qc).draw("mpl")

    The pass also sets the ``virtual_permutation_layout`` property set, storing
    the permutation of the virtual qubits that was optimized away.
