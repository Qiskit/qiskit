deprecations:
  - |
    The entire old version of the pulse-drawer stack is deprecated,
    including :meth:`.pulse.Instruction.draw` and everything in the
    :mod:`qiskit.visualization.pulse` package, including the
    ``WaveformDrawer`` and ``ScheduleDrawer`` classes.  These will all be
    removed in Terra 0.25 at the earliest.

    The user API for visualization of pulse-level objects is
    :func:`.pulse_drawer`, which has been available for several
    Terra versions already.
