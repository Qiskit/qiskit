deprecations:
  - |
    Deprecate the :meth:`qiskit.circuit.library.WeightedAdder.num_ancilla_qubits`
    method in favor of :meth:`qiskit.circuit.library.WeightedAdder.num_ancillas` for 
    consistency among all circuits.
fixes:
  - |
    Improve the allocation of helper qubits in `PolynomialPauliRotations`,
    `PiecewiseLinearPauliRotations` and use the allocated helper qubits in the MCX gate 
    in `WeightedAdder` (which have been allocated before but not used).
