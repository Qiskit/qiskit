    Fix a bug where the bit-order in
    :meth:`qiskit.circuit.library.PhaseOracle.evaluate_bitstring` did not agree with the 
    order of the measured bitstring. This fix also affects the execution of Grover's algorithm
    if the oracle is specified as :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.PhaseOracle`, which now
    correctly identifies the correct bitstring.
