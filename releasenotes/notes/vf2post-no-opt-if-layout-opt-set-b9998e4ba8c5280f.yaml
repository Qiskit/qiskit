    Fixed an issue with the :func:`.transpile` function and the generated pass manager
    objects returned by the :func:`.generate_preset_pass_manager` function when
    ``optimization_level`` argument is set as ``optimization_level=3`` and either an
    ``initial_layout`` or ``layout_method`` argument are set. The intent of the
    ``initial_layout`` argument or the ``layout_method`` arguments are for the transpiler
    to use those arguments for the layout and not use any other layout passes to try
    and use a different layout. However, for ``optimization_level=3`` the
    :class:`.VF2PostLayout` transpiler pass was being run at the end of the ``optimization``
    stage regardless of those arguments which could potentially lead to the transpiler
    selecting a different layout than was requested. This has been fixed so the pass is not
    run when those arguments are set
    Fixes `#14867 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/14867>`__
