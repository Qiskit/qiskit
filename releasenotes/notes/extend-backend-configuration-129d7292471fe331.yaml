    PulseBackendConfiguration (accessed normally as backend.configuration())
    has been extended with useful methods to explore its data and the
    functionality that exists in PulseChannelSpec. PulseChannelSpec will be 
    deprecated in the future.

    Example:
        backend = provider.get_backend(backend_name)
        config = backend.configuration()
        q0_drive = config.drive(0)  # or, DriveChannel(0)
        q0_meas = config.measure(0)  # MeasureChannel(0)
        q0_acquire = config.acquire(0)  # AcquireChannel(0)
        config.hamiltonian  # Returns a dictionary with hamiltonian info
        config.sample_rate()  # New method which returns 1 / dt

    The PulseBackendConfiguration `dt` and `dtm` attributes now return their
    values in standard units of seconds rather than nanoseconds. A warning is
    printed to the user.

        backend.configuration().dt   # in units of SECONDS
        backend.configuration().dtm  # in units of SECONDS
