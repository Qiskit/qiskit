fixes:
  - |
    Improved the error messages returned when an attempt to convert a fully bound
    :class:`.ParameterExpression` into a concrete ``float`` or ``int`` failed, for example because
    the expression was naturally a complex number.
  - |
    Fixed ``float`` conversions for :class:`.ParameterExpression` values which had, at some point in
    their construction history, an imaginary component that had subsequently been cancelled.  When
    using Sympy as a backend, these conversions would usually already have worked.  When using
    Symengine as the backend, these conversions would often fail with type errors, despite the
    result having been symbolically evaluated to be real, and :meth:`.ParameterExpression.is_real`
    being true.
