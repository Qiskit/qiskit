    Pub types for the estimator and the sampler now support an extra value where 
    the shape of the pub can be explicitly set instead of inferred from the other
    values.
  - |
    The containers :class:`~.EstimatorPub`, :class:`~.SamplerPub`, 
    :class:`~.BindingsArray`, :class:`~ObservablesArray` were added to the public interface.
    These can be used as inputs to primitives deriving from :class:`~BaseEstimatorV2` and 
    :class:`~BaseSamplerV2`, whereas before, they were an internal implementation detail 
    of the primitive input type coersion process.
