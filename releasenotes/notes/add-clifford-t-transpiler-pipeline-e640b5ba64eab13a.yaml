    Added a new function :func:`~.generate_clifford_t_pass_manager` which generates a
    :class:`~.PassManager` object for transpiling into the basis set of
    Clifford+T gates.

    For example::

      from qiskit.circuit import QuantumCircuit
      from qiskit.transpiler.preset_passmanagers import generate_clifford_t_pass_manager

      basis_gates = ["cx", "s", "sdg", "h", "t", "tdg"]
      pm = generate_clifford_t_pass_manager(basis_gates=basis_gates)

      qc1 = QuantumCircuit(1)
      qc1.rx(0.8, 0)
      qct1 = pm.run(qc1)
      print(qct1.count_ops())

      qc2 = QuantumCircuit(3)
      qc2.ccx(0, 1, 2)
      qct2 = pm.run(qc2)
      print(qct2.count_ops())

    For ``qc1``, the pass manager will internally call the Solovay-Kitaev decomposition to
    approximate the single-qubit rotation gate using ``H``, ``T`` and ``Tdg`` gates.
    For ``qc2``, the pass manager will produce the efficient decomposition of the Toffoli gate
    into Clifford+T gates.

    The Solovay-Kitaev unitary synthesis plugin (called with the "sk" method on the
    :class:`~.UnitarySynthesis` transpiler pass) has been extended to detect whether the
    given 1-qubit unitary gate happens to be Clifford, and if so produces the decomposition
    only consisting of simple Clifford gates.
