features:
  - |
    The :class:`~.SabreSwap` transpiler pass has significantly improved
    runtime performance due to a rewrite of the algorithm in Rust.
upgrade:
  - |
    The output from the :class:`~.SabreSwap` transpiler pass (including when
    ``optimization_level=3`` or ``routing_method`` or ``layout_method`` are
    set to ``'sabre'`` when calling :func:`~.transpile`) with a fixed
    seed value may change from previous releases. This is caused by a new
    random number generator being used as part of the rewrite of the
    :class:`~.SabreSwap` pass in Rust which significantly improved the
    performance. If you rely on having consistent output you can run
    the pass in an earlier version of Qiskit and leverage :mod:`qiskit.qpy`
    to save the circuit and then load it using the current version.
