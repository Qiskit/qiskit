    Added a new :class:`~.BaseSampler` implementation, :class:`~.BackendSampler`, which is
    used to create a sampler implementation from a :class:~.Backend` object. If a provider
    doesn't provide native primitive implementations the :class:`~.BackendSampler` class
    can be used to run anything that requires a sampler primitive object with any backend.
    For example::

        from qiskit.primitives import BackendSampler
        from qiskit.providers.fake_provider import FakeVigo

        sampler_for_retired_device = BackendSampler(backend=FakeVigo())
        qc = QuantumCircuit(2)
        qc.h(0)
        qc.cx(0, 1)
        qc.measure_all()
        sampler_for_retired_device.run(qc)
