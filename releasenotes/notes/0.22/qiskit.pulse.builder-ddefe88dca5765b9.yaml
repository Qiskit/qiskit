    The ``qiskit.pulse.builder`` contexts ``inline`` and ``pad`` have been
    removed.  These were first deprecated in Terra 0.18.0 (July 2021).  There is
    no replacement for ``inline``; one can simply write the pulses in the
    containing scope.  The ``pad`` context manager has had no effect since it
    was deprecated.
