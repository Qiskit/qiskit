    The ``subset_fitter`` method is added to the :class:`.TensoredMeasFitter`
    class. The implementation is restricted to mitigation patterns in which each
    qubit is mitigated individually, e.g. ``[[0], [1], [2]]``. This is, however,
    the most widely used case. It allows the :class:`.TensoredMeasFitter` to
    be used in cases where the numerical order of the physical qubits does not
    match the index of the classical bit.
