    Add a new entanglement method `entanglement="reverse_linear"` to :class:`~.NLocal` circuits.
    In the case of :class:`~.TwoLocal` circuits, if `entanglement_blocks="cx"` then
    `entanglement="reverse_linear"` actually provides the same n-qubit circuit as
    `entanglement="full"` but with only n-1 CX gates, instead of n(n-1)/2.
    For :class:`~.RealAmplitudes` and :class:`~.EfficientSU2` circuits, the default value
    has therefore been changed from `entanglement="full"` to `entanglement="reverse_linear"`.
