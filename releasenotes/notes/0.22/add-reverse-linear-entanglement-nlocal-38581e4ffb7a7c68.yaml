    Added a new supported value, ``"reverse_linear"`` for the ``entanglement`` keyword argument
    to the constructor for the :class:`~.NLocal` circuit class. For :class:`~.TwoLocal` circuits
    (which are subclassess of :class:`~.NLocal`), if ``entanglement_blocks="cx"`` then
    using ``entanglement="reverse_linear"`` provides an equivalent  n-qubit circuit as
    ``entanglement="full"`` but with only :math:`n-1` :class:`~.CXGate` gates, instead of
    :math:`\frac{n(n-1)}{2}`.
upgrade:
  - |
    The default value for the ``entanglement`` keyword argument on the constructor for the
    :class:`~.RealAmplitudes` and :class:`~.EfficientSU2` classes has changed from ``"full"`` to
    ``"reverse_linear"``. This change was made because the output circuit is equivalent but
    uses only :math:`n-1` instead of :math:`\frac{n(n-1)}{2}` :class:`~.CXGate` gates. If you
    desire the previous default you can explicitly set ``entanglement="full"`` when calling either
    constructor.
