    The :class:`~.SabreSwap` transpiler pass has a new keyword argument on its
    constructor, ``trials``. The ``trials`` argument is used to specify the
    number of random seed trials to attempt. The output from the
    `SABRE algorithm <https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.02573>`__  can differ greatly
    based on the seed used for the random number. :class:`~.SabreSwap` will
    now run the algorithm with ``trials`` number of random seeds and pick the
    best (with the fewest swaps inserted). If ``trials`` is not specified the
    pass will default to use the number of physical CPUs on the local system.

    The :class:`~.SabreLayout` transpiler pass has a new keyword argument on
    its constructor, ``swap_trials``. The ``swap_trials`` argument is used
    to specify how many random seed trials to run on the :class:`~.SabreSwap`
    pass internally. It corresponds to the ``trials`` arugment on the
    :class:`~.SabreSwap` pass. When set, each iteration of
    :class:`~.SabreSwap` will be run internally ``swap_trials`` times. 
    If ``swap_trials`` is not specified the will default to use
    the number of physical CPUs on the local system.
