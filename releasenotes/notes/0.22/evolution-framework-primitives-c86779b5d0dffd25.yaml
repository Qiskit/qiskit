features:
  - |
    Added :class:`qiskit.algorithms.time_evolvers` package with interfaces that will cover
    primitive-enabled time evolution algorithms:
    :class:`qiskit.algorithms.time_evolvers.TimeEvolutionProblem`,
    :class:`qiskit.algorithms.time_evolvers.TimeEvolutionResult`,
    :class:`qiskit.algorithms.time_evolvers.ImaginaryTimeEvolver`,
    :class:`qiskit.algorithms.time_evolvers.RealTimeEvolver`.
deprecations:
  - |
    :class:`qiskit.algorithms.evolvers` package will now issue a ``PendingDeprecationWarning``. It
    will be deprecated in a future release and subsequently removed after that. This is being
    replaced by the new :class:`qiskit.algorithms.time_evolvers` package that will host
    primitive-enabled algorithms.
