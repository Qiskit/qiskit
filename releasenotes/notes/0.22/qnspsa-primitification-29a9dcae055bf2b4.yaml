features:
  - |
    Add support for the :class:`.BaseSampler` primitive in :func:`.QNSPSA.get_fidelity`.
    Now, the fidelity function can be constructed as::

      from qiskit.primitives import Sampler
      from qiskit.algorithms.optimizers import QNSPSA

      fidelity = QNSPSA.get_fidelity(my_circuit, Sampler())

deprecations:
  - |
    Using a backend and expectation converter in :func:`.QNSPSA.get_fidelity` is
    pending deprecation and will be deprecated in a future release. Instead, use
    a :class:`.BaseSampler` to evaluate circuits, see also the features of this release.
