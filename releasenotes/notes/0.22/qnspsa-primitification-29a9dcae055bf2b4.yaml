    The :meth:`.QNSPSA.get_fidelity` static method now supports an optional
    ``sampler`` argument which is used to provide an implementation of the
    :class:`~.BaseSampler` interface (such as :class:`~.Sampler`,
    :class:`~.BackendSampler`, or any provider implementations such as those
    present in ``qiskit-ibm-runtime`` and ``qiskit-aer``) to compute the
    fidelity of a :class:`~.QuantumCircuit`. For example::

      from qiskit.primitives import Sampler
      from qiskit.algorithms.optimizers import QNSPSA

      fidelity = QNSPSA.get_fidelity(my_circuit, Sampler())
