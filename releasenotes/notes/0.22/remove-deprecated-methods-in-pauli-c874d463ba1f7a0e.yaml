upgrade:
  - |
    The deprecated method ``SparsePauliOp.table`` attribute has been removed.
    It was originally deprecated in Qiskit Terra 0.19. Instead the
    :meth:`~.SparsePauliOp.paulis` method should be used.
  - |
    Support for returning a :class:`~.PauliTable` from the
    :func:`~.pauli_basis` function has been removed. Similarly, the
    ``pauli_list`` argument on the :func:`~.pauli_basis` function which was
    used to switch to a :class:`~.PauliList` (now the only return type) has
    been removed. This functionality was deprecated in the Qiskit Terra 0.19 release.
