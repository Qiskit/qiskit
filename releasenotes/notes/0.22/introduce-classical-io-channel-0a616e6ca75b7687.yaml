features:
  - |
    Added a new abstract class :class:`~.ClassicalIOChannel` to the
    :mod:`qiskit.pulse.channels` module. This class is used to represent
    classical I/O channels and differentiate these channels from other
    subclasses of :class:`~qiskit.pulse.channels.Channel`. This new class is
    the base class for the :class:`~.MemorySlot`, :class:`~.RegisterSlot`,
    and :class:`~.SnapshotChannel` classes. Accordingly, the
    :func:`~qiskit.pulse.transforms.pad` canonicalization pulse transform in
    :mod:`qiskit.pulse.transforms` will not introduce delays to any instances
    of :class:`~.ClassicalIOChannel`

upgrade:
  - |
    The constructors for the :class:`~.SetPhase`, :class:`~.ShiftPhase`,
    :class:`~.SetFrequency`, and :class:`~.ShiftFrequency` classes will now
    raise a :class:`~.PulseError` if the value passed in via the ``channel``
    argument is not an instance of :class:`~.PulseChannel`. This change was
    made to validate the input to the constructors are valid as the
    instructions are only valid for pulse channels and not other types of
    channels.
