    In the qiskit.pulse.channels package, ClassicalIOChannel class has been added
    as an abstract base class of MemorySlot, RegisterSlot, and SnapshotChannel.

    The qiskit.pulse.transforms.canonicalization.pad method does not introduce
    delays to any channels which are instances of ClassicalIOChannel.

    In qiskit.pulse.instructions, the constructors to SetPhase, ShiftPhase,
    SetFrequency and ShiftFrequency now throw a PulseError if the channel parameter
    is not of type PulseChannel.
