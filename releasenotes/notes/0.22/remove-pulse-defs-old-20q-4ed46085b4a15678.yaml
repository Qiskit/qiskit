    The fake backend objects :class:`~.FakeJohannesburg`,
    :class:`~.FakeJohannesburgV2`, :class:`~.FakeAlmaden`,
    :class:`~.FakeAlmadenV2`, :class:`~.FakeSingapore`, and
    :class:`~.FakeSingaporeV2` no longer contain the pulse defaults payloads.
    This means for the :class:`~.BackendV1` based classes the
    :meth:`.BackendV1.defaults` method and pulse simulation via
    :meth:`.BackendV1.run` is no longer available. For :class:`~.BackendV2`
    based classes the :attr:`~InstructionProperties.calibration` property for
    instructions in the :class:`~.Target` is no longer populated. This
    change was done because these systems had exceedingly large pulse defaults
    payloads (in total ~50MB) due to using sampled waveforms instead of
    parameteric pulse definitions. These three payload files took > 50% of the
    disk space required to install qiskit-terra. When weighed against the
    potential value of being able to compile with pulse awareness or pulse
    simulate these retired devices the file size is not worth the cost. If
    you require to leverage these properties you can leverage an older version
    of Qiskit and leverage :mod:`~qiskit.qpy` to transfer circuits from
    older versions of qiskit into the current release.
