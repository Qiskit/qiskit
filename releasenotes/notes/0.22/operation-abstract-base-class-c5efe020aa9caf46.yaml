    Added a new :class:`.Operation` base class which provides a lightweight abstract interface
    for objects that can be put on :class:`.QuantumCircuit`. This allows to store "higher-level"
    objects directly on a circuit (for instance, :class:`.Clifford` objects), to directly combine such objects
    (for instance, to compose several consecutive :class:`.Clifford` objects over the same qubits), and
    to synthesize such objects at run time (for instance, to synthesize :class:`.Clifford` in
    a way that optimizes depth and/or exploits device connectivity).
    Previously, only subclasses of :class:`qiskit.circuit.Instruction` could be put on
    :class:`.QuantumCircuit`, but this interface has become unwieldy and includes too many methods
    and attributes for general-purpose objects.

    The new :class:`.Operation` interface includes ``name``, ``num_qubits`` and ``num_clbits``
    (in the future this may be slightly adjusted), but importantly does not include ``definition``
    (and thus does not tie synthesis to the object), does not include ``condition``
    (this should be part of separate classical control flow), and does not include ``duration`` and
    ``unit`` (as these are properties of the output of the transpiler).

    As of now, :class:`.Operation` includes :class:`.Gate`, :class:`.Reset`, :class:`.Barrier`,
    :class:`.Measure`, and "higher-level" objects such as :class:`.Clifford`. This list of
    "higher-level" objects will grow in the future.

    A :class:`.Clifford` is now added to a quantum circuit as an :class:`.Operation`, without first
    synthesizing a subcircuit implementing this Clifford. The actual synthesis is postponed
    to a later :class:`.HighLevelSynthesis` transpilation pass.

    For example, the following code::

        from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
        from qiskit.quantum_info import random_clifford

        qc = QuantumCircuit(3)
        cliff = random_clifford(2)
        qc.append(cliff, [0, 1])

    no longer converts ``cliff`` to :class:`qiskit.circuit.Instruction`, which includes
    synthesizing the clifford into a circuit, when it is appended to ``qc``.

    Added a new transpiler pass :class:`.OptimizeCliffords` that collects blocks of consecutive
    :class:`.Clifford` objects in a circuit, and replaces each block with a single :class:`.Clifford`.

    For example, the following code::

        from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
        from qiskit.quantum_info import random_clifford
        from qiskit.transpiler.passes import OptimizeCliffords
        from qiskit.transpiler import PassManager

        qc = QuantumCircuit(3)
        cliff1 = random_clifford(2)
        cliff2 = random_clifford(2)
        qc.append(cliff1, [2, 1])
        qc.append(cliff2, [2, 1])
        qc_optimized = PassManager(OptimizeCliffords()).run(qc)

    first stores the two Cliffords ``cliff1`` and ``cliff2`` on ``qc`` as "higher-level" objects,
    and then the transpiler pass :class:`.OptimizeCliffords` optimizes the circuit by composing
    these two Cliffords into a single Clifford. Note that the resulting Clifford is still stored
    on ``qc`` as a higher-level object. This pass is not yet included in any of preset pass
    managers.

    Added a new transpiler pass :class:`.HighLevelSynthesis` that synthesizes higher-level objects
    (for instance, :class:`.Clifford` objects).

    For example, the following code::

        from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
        from qiskit.quantum_info import random_clifford
        from qiskit.transpiler import PassManager
        from qiskit.transpiler.passes import HighLevelSynthesis

        qc = QuantumCircuit(3)
        qc.h(0)
        cliff = random_clifford(2)
        qc.append(cliff, [0, 1])

        qc_synthesized = PassManager(HighLevelSynthesis()).run(qc)

    will synthesize the higher-level Clifford stored in ``qc`` using the default
    :func:`~qiskit.quantum_info.decompose_clifford` function.

    This new transpiler pass :class:`.HighLevelSynthesis` is integrated into the preset pass managers,
    running right after :class:`.UnitarySynthesis` pass. Thus, :func:`.transpile` will
    synthesize all higher-level Cliffords present in the circuit.

    It is important to note that the work done to store :class:`.Clifford` objects as "higher-level"
    objects and to transpile these objects using :class:`.HighLevelSynthesis` pass should be completely
    transparent, and no code changes are required.
