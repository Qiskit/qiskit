    A new transpiler pass, :class:`.ConvertConditionsToIfOps` was added, which
    can be used to convert old-style :meth:`.Instruction.c_if`-conditioned
    instructions into :class:`.IfElseOp` objects.  This is to help ease the transition
    from the old type to the new type for backends.  For most users, there is no
    need to add this to your pass managers, and it is not included in any preset
    pass managers.
