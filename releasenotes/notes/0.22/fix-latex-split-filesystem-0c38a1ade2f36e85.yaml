    Fixed an issue in :func:`~.circuit_drawer` and :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.draw`
    with the ``latex`` method where an ``OSError`` would be raised on systems
    whose temporary directories (*e.g* ``/tmp``) are on a different
    filesystem than the working directory.
    Fixes `#8542 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/8542>`__
