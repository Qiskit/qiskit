    Added a new transpiler pass, :class:`~.ResetAfterMeasureSimplification`,
    which is used to replace a :class:`~.Reset` operation after a
    :class:`~.Measure` with a conditional :class:`~.XGate`. This pass can
    be used on backends where a :class:`~.Reset` operation is performed by
    doing a measurement and then a conditional X gate so that this will
    remove the duplicate implicit :class:`~.Measure` from the :class:`~.Reset`
    operation. For example:

    .. code-block::

        from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
        from qiskit.transpiler.passes import ResetAfterMeasureSimplification

        qc = QuantumCircuit(1)
        qc.measure_all()
        qc.reset(0)
        qc.draw('mpl')

    .. code-block::

        result = ResetAfterMeasureSimplification()(qc)
        result.draw('mpl')
