    The preset pass managers for levels 1 and 2, which will be used when
    ``optimization_level=1`` or ``optimization_level=2`` with
    :func:`~.transpile` or :func:`~.generate_preset_pass_manager` and output
    from :func:`~.level_1_pass_manager` and :func:`~.level_2_pass_manager`,
    will now use :class:`~.SabreLayout` and :class:`~SabreSwap` by default
    instead of the previous defaults :class:`~.DenseLayout` and
    :class:`~.StochasticSwap`. This change was made to improve the output
    quality of the transpiler, the :class:`~.SabreLayout` and
    :class:`~SabreSwap` combination typically results in fewer
    :class:`~.SwapGate` objects being inserted into the output circuit.
    If you would like to use the previous default passes you can set
    ``layout_method='dense'`` and ``routing_method='stochastic'`` on
    :func:`~.transpile` or :func:`~.generate_preset_pass_manager` to
    leverage :class:`~.DenseLayout` and :class:`~.StochasticSwap` respectively.
