    The :class:`~.Z2Symmetries` class has two new methods,
    :meth:`~.Z2Symmetries.convert_clifford` and
    :meth:`~.Z2Symmetries.taper_clifford`. These two methods are the two
    operations necessary for taperng an operator based on the Z2 symmetries
    in the object and were previously performed internally via the
    :meth:`~.Z2Symmetries.taper` method. However, these methods are now
    public methods of the class which can be called individually if needed.
