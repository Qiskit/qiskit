    Added a new :class:`~qiskit.algorithms.time_evolvers.trotterization.TrotterQRTE` class
    that implements the :class:`~.RealTimeEvolver` interface that uses an
    :class:`qiskit.primitives.BaseEstimator` to perform the calculation. This
    new class supersedes the previously available :class:`qiskit.algorithms.TrotterQRTE`
    class (which will be deprecated and subsequenty removed in future releases) that used
    a :class:`~.Backend` or :class:`~QuantumInstance` to perform the calculation.
