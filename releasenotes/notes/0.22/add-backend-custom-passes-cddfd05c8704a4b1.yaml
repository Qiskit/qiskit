    The :class:`~.BackendV2` class now has support for two new optional hook
    points enabling backends to inject custom compilation steps as part of
    :func:`~.transpile` and :func:`~.generate_preset_pass_manager`. If a
    :class:`~.BackendV2` implementation includes the methods
    ``get_scheduling_stage_plugin()`` or ``get_translation_stage_plugin()`` the
    transpiler will use the returned string as the default value for
    the ``scheduling_method`` and ``translation_method`` arguments. This enables
    backends to run additional custom transpiler passes when targetting that
    backend by leveraging the transpiler stage
    :mod:`~qiskit.transpiler.preset_passmanagers.plugin` interface.
    For more details on how to use this see: :ref:`custom_transpiler_backend`.

    Added a new keyword argument, ``ignore_backend_supplied_default_methods``, to the
    :func:`~.transpile` function which can be used to disable a backend's
    custom selection of a default method if the target backend has
    ``get_scheduling_stage_plugin()`` or ``get_translation_stage_plugin()``
    defined.
