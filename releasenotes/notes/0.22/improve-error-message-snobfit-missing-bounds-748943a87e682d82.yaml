    Fixed an issue in the :class:`~.SNOBFIT` optimizer class when an
    internal error would be raised during the execution of the
    :meth:`~.SNOBFIT.minimize` method if no input bounds where specified.
    This is now checked at call time to quickly raise a ``ValueError`` if
    required bounds are missing from the :meth:`~.SNOBFIT.minimize` call.
    Fixes `#8580 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/8580>`__
