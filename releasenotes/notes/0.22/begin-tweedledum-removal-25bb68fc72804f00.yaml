    For most architectures starting in the following release of Qiskit Terra,
    0.23, the ``tweedledum`` package will become an optional dependency, instead
    of a requirement.  This is currently used by some classical phase-oracle
    functions.  If your application or library needs this functionality, you may
    want to prepare by adding ``tweedledum`` to your package's dependencies
    immediately.

    ``tweedledum`` is no longer a requirement on macOS arm64 (M1) with immediate
    effect in Qiskit Terra 0.22.  This is because the provided wheels for this
    platform are broken, and building from the sdist is not reliable for most
    people.  If you manually install a working version of ``tweedledum``, all
    the dependent functionality will continue to work.
deprecations:
  - |
    Importing the names ``Int1``, ``Int2``, ``classical_function`` and
    ``BooleanExpression`` directly from :mod:`qiskit.circuit` is deprecated.
    This is part of the move to make ``tweedledum`` an optional dependency rather
    than a full requirement.  Instead, you should import these names from
    :mod:`qiskit.circuit.classicalfunction`.
