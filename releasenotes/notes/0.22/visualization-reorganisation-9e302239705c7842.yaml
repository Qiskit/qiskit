    The visualization module :mod:`qiskit.visualization` has seen some internal
    reorganization.  This should not have affected the public interface, but if
    you were accessing any internals of the circuit drawers, they may now be in
    different places.  The only parts of the visualization module that are
    considered public are the components that are documented in this online
    documentation.
