    Introduced a new plugin interface for transpiler stages which is used to
    enable alternative :class:`~.PassManager` objects from an external package
    in a particular stage as part of :func:`~.transpile` or the
    :class:`~.StagedPassManager` output from
    :func:`~.generate_preset_pass_manager`, :func:`~.level_0_pass_manager`,
    :func:`~.level_1_pass_manager`, :func:`~.level_2_pass_manager`, and
    :func:`~.level_3_pass_manager`. Users can select a plugin to use for a
    transpiler stage with the ``init_method``, ``layout_method``,
    ``routing_method``, ``translation_method``, ``optimization_method``, and
    ``scheduling_method`` keyword arguments on :func:`~.transpile` and
    :func:`~.generate_preset_pass_manager`. A full list of plugin names
    currently installed can be found with the :func:`.list_stage_plugins`
    function. For creating plugins refer to the
    :mod:`qiskit.transpiler.preset_passmanagers.plugin` module documentation
    which includes a guide for writing stage plugins.

    The :func:`~.transpile` has two new keyword arguments, ``init_method`` and
    ``optimization_method`` which are used to specify alternative plugins to
    use for the ``init`` stage and ``optimization`` stages respectively.
  - |
    The :class:`~.PassManagerConfig` class has 2 new attributes,
    :attr:`~.PassManagerConfig.init_method` and
    :attr:`~.PassManagerConfig.optimization_method`
    along with matching keyword arguments on the constructor methods. These represent
    the user specified ``init`` and ``optimization`` plugins to use for
    compilation.
