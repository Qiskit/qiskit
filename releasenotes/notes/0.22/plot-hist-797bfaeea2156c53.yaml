    Added a new function :func:`~.plot_distribution` for plotting distributions over quasi-probabilities.
    This is suitable for ``Counts``, ``QuasiDistribution`` and ``ProbDistribution``.
    Raw `dict` can be passed as well. For example:

    .. code-block::

        from qiskit.visualization import plot_distribution

        quasi_dist = {'0': .98, '1': -.01}
        plot_distribution(quasi_dist)

    The :func:`~.plot_histogram` function has been modified to return an actual
    histogram of discrete binned values. The previous behavior for the function
    was despite the name to actually generate a visualization of the distribution
    of the input. Due to this disparity between the name of the function and the behavior
    the function behavior was changed so it's actually generating a proper histogram
    of discrete data now. If you wish to preserve the previous behavior of plotting a
    probability distribution of the counts data you can leverage the :func:`~.plot_distribution` to generate an
    equivalent graph. For example, the previous behavior of
    ``plot_histogram({'00': 512, '11': 500})`` can be re-created with:

    .. code-block::

        from qiskit.visualization import plot_distribution
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

        ax = plt.subplot()
        plot_distribution({'00': 512, '11': 500}, ax=ax)
        ax.set_ylabel('Probabilities')
