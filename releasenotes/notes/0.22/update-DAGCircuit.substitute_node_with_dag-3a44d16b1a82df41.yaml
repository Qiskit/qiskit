    :meth:`.DAGCircuit.substitute_node_with_dag` now takes ``propagate_condition``
    as a keyword argument.  This defaults to ``True``, which was the previous
    behavior, and copies any condition on the node to be replaced onto every
    operation node in the replacement.  If set to ``False``, the condition will
    not be copied, which allows replacement of a conditional node with a sub-DAG
    that already faithfully implements the condition.

    :meth:`.DAGCircuit.substitute_node_with_dag` can now take a mapping for its
    ``wires`` parameter as well as a sequence.  The mapping should map bits in
    the replacement DAG to the bits in the DAG it is being inserted into.  This
    permits an easier style of construction for callers when the input node has
    both classical bits and a condition, and the replacement DAG may use these
    out-of-order.
