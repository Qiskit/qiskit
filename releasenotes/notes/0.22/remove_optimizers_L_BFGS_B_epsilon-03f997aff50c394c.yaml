    The deprecated arguments ``epsilon`` and ``factr`` for the constructor of
    the  :class:`~.L_BFGS_B` optimizer class have been removed. These arguments
    were originally deprecated as part of the 0.18.0 release (released on
    July 12, 2021). Instead the ``ftol`` argument should be used, you
    can refer to the `scipy docs <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/optimize.minimize-lbfgsb.html.>`__
    on the optimizer for more detail on the relationship between these arguments.
