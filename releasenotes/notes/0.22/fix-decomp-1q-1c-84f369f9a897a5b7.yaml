    Fixed a bug where decomposing an instruction with one qubit and one classical bit 
    containing a single quantum gate failed. Now the following decomposes as expected::

        block = QuantumCircuit(1, 1)
        block.h(0)

        circuit = QuantumCircuit(1, 1)
        circuit.append(block, [0], [0])

        decomposed = circuit.decompose()
