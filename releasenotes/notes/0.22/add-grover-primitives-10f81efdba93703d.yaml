    The :class:`~.Grover` class has a new keyword argument, ``sampler`` which is
    used to run the algorithm using an instance of the :class:`~.BaseSampler`
    interface to calculate the results. This new argument supersedes the
    the ``quantum_instance`` argument and accordingly, ``quantum_instance``
    is pending deprecation and will be deprecated and subsequently removed in
    future releases.

    Example:

    .. code-block:: python

        from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
        from qiskit.primitives import Sampler
        from qiskit.algorithms import Grover, AmplificationProblem

        sampler = Sampler()
        oracle = QuantumCircuit(2)
        oracle.cz(0, 1)
        problem = AmplificationProblem(oracle, is_good_state=["11"])
        grover = Grover(sampler=sampler)
        result = grover.amplify(problem)
