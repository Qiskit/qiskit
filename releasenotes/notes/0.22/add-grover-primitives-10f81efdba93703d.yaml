    :class:`~.Grover` supports the primitives and can use :class:`~.BaseSampler` to
    calculate the results. Accordingly, ``quantum instance`` in :class:`~.Grover`
    is pending deprecation and will be deprecated in a future release.

    Example:

    .. code-block:: python

      from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
      from qiskit.primitives import Sampler
      from qiskit.algorithms import Grover, AmplificationProblem

      sampler = Sampler()
      oracle = QuantumCircuit(2)
      oracle.cz(0, 1)
      problem = AmplificationProblem(oracle, is_good_state=["11"])
      grover = Grover(sampler=sampler)
      result = grover.amplify(problem)

     Using a :class:`~.QuantumInstance` in :class:`~.Grover` is
     pending deprecation and will be deprecated in a future release. Instead, use
     a :class:`.BaseSampler` to calculate the results, see also the features of this release.
