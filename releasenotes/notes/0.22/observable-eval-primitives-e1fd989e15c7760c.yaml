    Added a new function, :func:`~.estimate_observables` which uses an
    implementation of the :class:`~.BaseEstimator` interface (e.g.
    :class:`~.Estimator`, :class:`~.BackendEstimator`, or any provider
    implementations such as those as those present in ``qiskit-ibm-runtime``
    and ``qiskit-aer``) to calculate the expectation values, their means and
    standard deviations from a list or dictionary of observables. This
    serves a similar purpose to the pre-existing function
    :func:`~.eval_observables` which performed the calculation using
    a :class:`~.QuantumInstance` object and has been superseded (and will be
    deprecated and subsequently removed in future releases) by this
    new function.
