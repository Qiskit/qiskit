    Symbolic pulse subclasses :class:`.Gaussian`, :class:`.GaussianSquare`,
    :class:`.Drag` and :class:`.Constant` have been upgraded to
    instantiate :class:`SymbolicPulse` rather than the subclass itself.
    All parametric pulse objects in pulse programs must be symbolic pulse instances,
    because subclassing is no longer necessary. Note that :class:`SymbolicPulse` can
    uniquely identify a particular envelope with the symbolic expression object
    defined in :attr:`SymbolicPulse.envelope`.

    ``isinstance`` check with pulse classes :class:`.Gaussian`, :class:`.GaussianSquare`,
    :class:`.Drag` and :class:`.Constant` will be invalidated because
    these pulse subclasses are no longer instantiated.  They will still work in Terra 0.22,
    but you should begin transitioning immediately.
    Instead of using type information, :attr:`SymbolicPulse.pulse_type` should be used.
    This is assumed to be a unique string identifier for pulse envelopes,
    and we can use string equality to investigate the pulse types. For example,

    .. code-block:: python

      from qiskit.pulse.library import Gaussian

      pulse = Gaussian(160, 0.1, 40)

      if isinstance(pulse, Gaussian):
        print("This is Gaussian pulse.")

    This code should be upgraded to

    .. code-block:: python

      from qiskit.pulse.library import Gaussian

      pulse = Gaussian(160, 0.1, 40)

      if pulse.pulse_type == "Gaussian":
        print("This is Gaussian pulse.")

    With the same reason, the class attributes such as ``pulse.__class__.__name__``
    should not be accessed to get pulse type information.
