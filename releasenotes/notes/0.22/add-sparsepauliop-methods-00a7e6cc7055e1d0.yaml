    Added a new method :meth:`.SparsePauliOp.argsort`, which
    returns the composition of permutations in the order of sorting
    by coefficient and sorting by Pauli. By using the ``weight``
    keyword argument for the method the output can additionally be sorted
    by the number of non-identity terms in the Pauli, where the set of
    all Paulis of a given weight are still ordered lexicographically.

    Added a new method :meth:`.SparsePauliOp.sort`, which will first
    sort the coefficients using numpy's ``argsort()`` and then sort
    by Pauli, where the Pauli sort takes precedence. If the Pauli sort
    is the same, it will then be sorted by coefficient. By using the
    ``weight`` keyword argument the output can additionally  be sorted
    by the number of non-identity terms in the Pauli, where the set of
    all Paulis of a given weight are still ordered lexicographically.
