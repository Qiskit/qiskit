    Comparing :class:`.QuantumCircuit` and :class:`.DAGCircuit`\ s for equality
    was previously non-deterministic if the circuits contained more than one
    register of the same type (*e.g.* two or more :class:`.QuantumRegister`\ s),
    sometimes returning ``False`` even if the registers were identical.  It will
    now correctly compare circuits with multiple registers.
