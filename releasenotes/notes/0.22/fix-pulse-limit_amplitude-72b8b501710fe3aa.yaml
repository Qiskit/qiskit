    A bug that ``limit_amplitude`` set to an individual symbolic pulse or waveform instance
    is not properly reflected to the parameter validation has been fixed.
    In addition, QPY schedule ``dump`` has been fixed to save ``limit_amplitude`` value
    tied to the instance, rather than saving the global class variable.
