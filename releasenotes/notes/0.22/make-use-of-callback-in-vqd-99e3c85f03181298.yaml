features:
  - |
    Add calls of the callback function during the :meth:`energy_evaluation` to track the progress of
    the algorithm. Also adds a ``step`` argument to the callback to track which eigenstates of the 
    Hamiltonian is currently being optimized.
issues:
  - |
    The callback function in the :class:`VQD` was defined but never used.
