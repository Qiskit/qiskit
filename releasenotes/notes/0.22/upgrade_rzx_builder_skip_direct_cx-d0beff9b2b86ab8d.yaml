upgrade:
  - |
    :class:`.RZXCalibrationBuilder` and :class:`.RZXCalibrationBuilderNoEcho`
    have been upgraded to skip stretching CX gates implemented by
    non-echoed cross resonance (ECR) sequence to avoid termination of the pass
    with unexpected errors.
    These passes take new argument ``verbose`` that controls whether the passes
    warn when this occurs. If ``verbose=True`` is set, pass raises user warning
    when it enconters non-ECR sequence.
deprecations:
  - |
    The unused argument ``qubit_channel_mapping`` in the
    :class:`.RZXCalibrationBuilder` and :class:`.RZXCalibrationBuilderNoEcho`
    transpiler passes have been deprecated and will be removed in a future
    release. This argument is no longer used and has no effect on the
    operation of the passes.
