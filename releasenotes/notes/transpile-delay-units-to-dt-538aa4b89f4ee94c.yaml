    The circuit instruction `delay` will now be transpiled to units understood
    by the target backend, i.e. units of dt. Thus, the following valid code
    will execute as expected::

        qc = QuantumCircuit(1)
        qc.delay(100, [0], unit='us')

        qc = transpile(qc, backend)

        job = execute(qc, backend)

    Previously, the backend would delay for 100 timesteps (each of duration dt)
    rather than (100e-6 / dt) timesteps.
