prelude: >
    A library of quantum circuits is introduced in ``qiskit.circuit.library``.
    This library contains useful circuits which can be used for experiments or
    be used as subcircuits in building up other circuits. The contents of this
    library will grow over time and better implementations will be introduced.
features:
  - |
    A few simple circuits for basic boolean logic operations such as ``shift``,
    ``permutation``, and ``inner_product`` are added to
    ``qiskit.circuit.library``.
