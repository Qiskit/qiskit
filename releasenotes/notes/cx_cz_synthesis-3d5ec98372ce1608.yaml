    Add a new synthesis algorithm `.synth_cx_cz_depth_line_my` of a CX circuit 
    accompanied by a CZ circuit for linear nearest neighbor (LNN) connectivity in 
    2-qubit depth of 5n using CX and phase gates (S, Sdg or Z). For example, let
    mat_x be an invertable binary matrix representing a CX circuit, and let mat_z 
    be a binary symmetric matrix representing a CZ circuit. Calling
    synth_cx_cz_depth_line_my(mat_x, mat_z) returns a quantum circuit object with 
    two-qubit-depth at most 5n computing the composition of the CX and CZ circuits. 
    The synthesis algorithm is based on the paper of Maslov and Yang 
    (https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16195).
    For LNN connectivity in 2-qubit depth of 7n+2 (which is still not optimal),
    using the layered Clifford synthesis (`.synth_clifford_layers`),
    `.synth_cx_cz_depth_line_my` to synthesize the CX layer and the first CZ layer in 
    depth 5n, and `.synth_cz_depth_line_mr` to synthesize the second CZ layers in depth 2n+2.
    This PR will be followed by another PR that performs further local optimizations between 
    two layers, and hence reduce the depth of a Clifford circuit to 7n-4 for LNN connectivity.
