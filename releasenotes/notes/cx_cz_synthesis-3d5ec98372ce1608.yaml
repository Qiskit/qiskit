    Add a new synthesis algorithm `.synth_cx_cz_line_my` of a CX circuit 
    accompanied by a CZ circuit for linear nearest neighbor (LNN) connectivity in 
    2-qubit depth of 5n using CX and phase gates (S, Sdg or Z). The synthesis algorithm 
    is based on the paper of Maslov and Yang (https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16195).
    For LNN connectivity in 2-qubit depth of 7n+2 (which is still not optimal),
    using the layered Clifford synthesis (`.synth_clifford_layers`),
    `.synth_cx_cz_line_my` to synthesize the CX layer and the first CZ layer in 
    depth 5n, and `.synth_cz_depth_line_mr` to synthesize the second CZ layers in depth 2n+2.
    This PR will be followed by another PR that performs further local optimizations between 
    two layers, and hence reduce the depth of a Clifford circuit to 7n-4 for LNN connectivity.
