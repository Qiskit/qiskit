    The ``Instruction.is_parameterized`` method had previously returned ``True``
    for any ``Instruction`` instance which had a ``Parameter`` in any element
    if its ``params`` array, even if that ``Parameter`` had been fully bound.
    This has been corrected so that ``.is_parameterized`` will return ``False``
    when the instruction is fully bound.
