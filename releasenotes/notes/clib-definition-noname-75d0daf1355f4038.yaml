    The name of the circuit produced as definitions of circuit library gates were set to ``None``.
    Previously, these circuits had the same name as the gate, making it very easy to construct
    opaque gates with names matching a standard gate. This violates a common assumption in Qiskit,
    where standard gate names should be unique.
