    Fixed a potential source of non-determinism in :class:`~.DenseLayout` (and
    by extension :class:`~.SabreLayout`) when targeting a
    :class:`.CouplingMap` or :class:`.Target` that has more than one subgraph
    with the same degree of connectivity. In these case the exact output
    layout from the pass could previously fluctuate based on the number of
    local CPUs and thread execution speed.
