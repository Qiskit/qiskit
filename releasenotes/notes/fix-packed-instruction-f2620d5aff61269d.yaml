    ``PackedInstruction``, the principal representation of an instance of :class:`.CircuitInstruction`
    in Rust, has been re-organized to discard its cached instance of a python :class:`.Gate` whenever its
    operation, parameters, or extra attributes are modified. This results in ``PackedInstruction`` no
    longer having shared references between them.
