    The :class:`~.SabreLayout` pass now supports running against a target
    with a disjoint :class:`~.CouplimgMap`. When targeting a disjoint coupling
    the input :class:`.DAGCircuit` is split into it's connected components of
    virtual qubits and then each component is mapped to the connected components
    of the :class:`~.CouplingMap` and then the layout is run on each connected
    component in isolation and then the returned layout is the combination of
    each layout. Note when the ``routing_pass`` argument is set the pass doesn't
    support running with s disjoint connectivity.
