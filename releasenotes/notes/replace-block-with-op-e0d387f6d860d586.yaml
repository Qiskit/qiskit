    Added a new method,
    :meth:`~qiskit.dagcircuit.DAGCircuit.replace_block_with_op`, to the
    :class:`~qiskit.dagcircuit.DAGCircuit` class. This method is used to replace
    a block of nodes in the DAG with a single operation. The cannonical example
    is for the :class:`~qiskit.transpiler.passes.ConsolidateBlocks` pass which
    replaces blocks of nodes with equivalent
    :class:`~qiskit.extensions.UnitaryGate` nodes.

    Added a new analysis transpiler pass,
    :class:`~qiskit.transpiler.passes.Collect1qRuns`, to the
    :mod:`qiskit.transpiler.passes` module. This pass is used to find sequences
    of uninterrupted gates acting on a single qubit. It's similar to the
    :class:`~qiskit.transpiler.passes.Collect2qBlocks` and
    :class:`~qiskit.transpiler.passes.CollectMultiQBlocks` but optimized for
    single qubit runs instead of multiple qubit blocks.
