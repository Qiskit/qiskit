    The ``python-dateutil`` library is no longer a dependency of Qiskit. Since
    Qiskit 2.0.0 nothing in the library was actively using the library anymore
    and Qiskit didn't actually depend on the library anymore. This release
    removes it from the dependency list so it is not automatically installed
    as a prerequisite anymore. If you were relying on Qiskit to install
    dateutil for you as a dependency you will now need to ensure you're manually
    installing it (which is best practice for direct dependencies).
