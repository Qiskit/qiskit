    Previously when a conditional gate was entered in a circuit
    following a measure that used the same classical register,
    it was possible in certain circumstances for the conditional
    gate to be displayed to the left of the measure in the drawers.
    This affected all the circuit drawers - `text`, `mpl`, and
    `latex`. With this release, the conditional gate will always
    display to the right of a measure on the same register.
