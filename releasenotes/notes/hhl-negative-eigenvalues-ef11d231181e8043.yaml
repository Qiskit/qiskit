    Modified the HHL class within the linear solvers package and the ExactReciprocal 
    class in the arithmetics package so that the quantum algorithm for linear systems
    can find the solution when the matrix has negative eigenvalues. The modification
    was required because the eigenvalues are represented digitally within the algorithm
    but there was no logic in place to store the sign. Now there is an additional qubit 
    storing the sign and the appropriate logic in ExactReciprocal to process the right
    value.
