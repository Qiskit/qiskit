    Added a new synthesis method of a Clifford circuit into layers, based on a paper by
    Bravyi and Maslov (arxiv:2003.09412).
    It decomposes the Clifford into 8 layers of gates.
    There are two layers of CZ gates, and one layer of CX gates.

    For example, a 5-qubit Clifford circuit is decomposed into the following layers:

        from from qiskit.quantum_info import random_clifford
        from qiskit.synthesis.clifford.clifford_decompose_layers import synth_clifford_layers
        cliff = random_clifford(5)
        circ = synth_clifford_layers(cliff)
        print (circ)

    This method will allow to decompose a Clifford circuit in 2-qubit depth 7n+2 for
    linear nearest neighbor (LNN) connectivity.
    Since a CZ circuit can be decomposed in 2-qubit depth 2n by arxiv:1705.09176,
    and a CX-CZ circuit can be decomposed in 2-qubit depth 2n by arxiv:2210.16195.
    These algorithms will be added in future PRs.
