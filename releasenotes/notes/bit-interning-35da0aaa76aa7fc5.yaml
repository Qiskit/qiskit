    To support a more compact in-memory representation, the
    :class:`.QuantumCircuit` class is now limited to supporting
    a maximum of ``2^32 (=4,294,967,296)`` qubits and clbits,
    for each of these two bit types (the limit is not combined).
    The number of unique sequences of indices used in
    :attr:`.CircuitInstruction.qubits` and
    :attr:`.CircuitInstruction.clbits` is also limited to ``2^32``
    for instructions added to a single circuit.

    The :class:`.QuantumCircuit` class now performs interning for the
    ``qubits`` and ``clbits`` of the :class:`.CircuitInstruction`
    instances that it stores, resulting in a potentially significant
    reduction in memory footprint, especially for large circuits.
