    The internal handling of custom circuit calibrations and :class:`.InstructionDurations`
    has been offloaded from the :func:`.transpile` function to the individual transpiler passes: 
    :class:`qiskit.transpiler.passes.scheduling.DynamicalDecoupling`,
    :class:`qiskit.transpiler.passes.scheduling.padding.DynamicalDecoupling`. Before, 
    instruction durations from circuit calibrations would not be taken into account unless 
    they were manually incorporated into `instruction_durations` input argument, but the passes
    that need it now analyze the circuit and pick the most relevant duration value according 
    to the following priority order: target > custom input > circuit calibrations.

    Fixed a bug in :func:`.transpile` where the ``num_processes`` argument would only be used
    if ``dt`` or ``instruction_durations`` were provided.
