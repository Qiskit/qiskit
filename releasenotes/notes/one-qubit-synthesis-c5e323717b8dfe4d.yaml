features:
  - |
    Improves the `quantum_info.synthesis.OneQubitEulerDecomposer` class by
    adding methods `angles`, `angles_and_phase` methods for 
    returning relevant parameters without validation, and the `__call__` 
    method which performs full synthesis with validation.
  - |
    Adds `RR` decomposition basis to the
    `quantum_info.synthesis.OneQubitEulerDecomposer` for decomposiing an
    arbitrary 2x2 unitary into a two `RGate` circuit.
deprecations:
  - |
    Deprecates `quantum_info.synthesis.euler_angles_1q` It is superseded by the
    `qauntum_info.synthesis.OneQubitEulerDecomposer` class which provides the
    same functionality though `OneQubitEulerDecomposer().angles(mat)`.
