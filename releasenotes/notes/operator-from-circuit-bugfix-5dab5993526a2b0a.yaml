    Added a new test case to check the initialization of :class:`.Operator` via :meth:`.Operator.from_circuit`
    when both an initial layout and a final layout is specified in the `_layout` attribute of a :class:`.QuantumCircuit` object.
    Previously, the final layout was processed without regards for the initial layout, i.e. the
    initialization was incorrect for all quantum circuits that have a non-trivial initial layout. In
    addition, this behavior was fixed in :meth:`.Operator.from_circuit`, i.e. an :class:`.Operator` can
    now be correctly initialized from a quantum circuit with arbitrary initial and final layouts.
    Lastly, the documentation of the constructor of :class:`.Operator` was adapted to hint to :meth:`.Operator.from_circuit`
    when e.g. the equivalency of two operators should be determined with non-canonical qubit permutations
    specified via initial and final layouts.
