    Add ``ControlledGate`` class for representing controlled
    gates. Controlled gate instances are created with the
    ``control(n)`` method of ``Gate`` objects where ``n`` represents
    the number of controls. The control qubits come before the
    controlled qubits in the new gate. For example::

      from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
      from qiskit.extensions import HGate
      hgate = HGate()
      circ = QuantumCircuit(4)
      circ.append(hgate.control(3), [0, 1, 2, 3])
      print(circ)

    generates::

      q_0: |0>──■──
                │  
      q_1: |0>──■──
                │  
      q_2: |0>──■──
              ┌─┴─┐
      q_3: |0>┤ H ├
              └───┘
