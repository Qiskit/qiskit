    Fixed an issue in QPY serialization (:func:`~.qpy.dump`) when a custom
    :class:`~.ControlledGate` subclass that overloaded the ``_define()``
    method to provide a custom definition for the operation. Previously,
    this case of operation was not serialized correctly because it wasn't
    accounting for using the potentially ``_define()`` method to provide
    a definition.
    Fixes `#8794 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/8794>`__
