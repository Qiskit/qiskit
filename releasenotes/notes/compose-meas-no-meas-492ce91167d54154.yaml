    :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.compose` will now accept an operand with classical
    bits if the base circuit has none itself, as a convenience.  The pattern
    of composing a circuit with measurements onto a quantum-only circuit is
    now valid::

      from qiskit import QuantumCircuit

      base = QuantumCircuit(3)
      terminus = QuantumCircuit(3, 3)
      terminus.measure_all()

      # This will now succeed, though it was previously a CircuitError.
      base.compose(terminus)
