    The :class:`qiskit.circuit.equivalence.EquivalenceLibrary` is now
    represented internally as a ``PyDiGraph``. As part of this change,
    three new attributes are now public-facing - ``graph``: the graph
    representation of the EquivalenceLibrary, ``key_to_node_index``:
    a mapping of the library keys to the graph node indices, and
    ``num_gates_for_rule``: a count of how many gates make up each
    equivalence rule. These attributes are intendeed for use internally
    in qiskit and therefore should always be copied before being modified
    by the user to prevent possible corruption of the internal equivalence
    graph.
