    The :class:`qiskit.circuit.equivalence.EquivalenceLibrary` is now
    represented internally as a ``PyDiGraph``. As part of this change,
    there is a new public-facing attribute - ``graph``: the graph
    representation of the EquivalenceLibrary. This attribute is
    intended for use internally in qiskit and therefore should always
    be copied before being modified by the user to prevent possible
    corruption of the internal equivalence graph.
