    When accessing the ``definition`` attribute of a parameterized ``Gate``
    instance, the generated ``QuantumCircuit`` had been generated with an invalid
    ``ParameterTable``, such that reading from ``QuantumCircuit.parameters`` or
    calling ``QuantumCircuit.bind_parameters`` would incorrectly report the
    unbound parameters. This has been resolved.
