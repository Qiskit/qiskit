    Fixed :class:`.SabreSwap`, and by extension :func:`.transpile` with
    ``optimization_level=3``, occasionally re-ordering measurements invalidly.
    Previously, if two measurements wrote to the same classical bit,
    :class:`.SabreSwap` could (depending on the coupling map) re-order them to
    produce a non-equivalent circuit.  This behaviour was stochastic, so may
    not have appeared reliably.
