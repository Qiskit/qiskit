    The deprecated :class:`.Qubit` and :class:`.Clbit` properties :attr:`~.Qubit.register` and
    :attr:`~.Qubit.index` will now be correctly round-tripped by QPY (:mod:`qiskit.qpy`) in most
    standard usage patterns of :class:`.QuantumRegister` and :class:`.ClassicalRegister` uses.  In
    earlier releases in the Terra 0.23 series, this information could be lost.  The correct way to
    retrieve the index of a bit within a circuit, and any registers in that circuit the bit is
    contained within is to call :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.find_bit`.  This method will return the
    correct information in all versions of Terra in the 0.23 series.

    QPY cannot completely round-trip the deprecated bit information in complex cases where some, but
    not all, bits created by the construction of a register are put into a circuit, and that owning
    register isn't.  This is unlikely to cause any practical problems.
