    The deprecated :class:`.Qubit` and :class:`.Clbit` properties :attr:`~.Qubit.register` and
    :attr:`~.Qubit.index` will now be correctly round-tripped by QPY (:mod:`qiskit.qpy`) in all
    valid usages of :class:`.QuantumRegister` and :class:`.ClassicalRegister`.  In earlier releases
    in the Terra 0.23 series, this information would be lost.  In versions before 0.23.0, this
    information was partially reconstructed but could be incorrect or produce invalid circuits for
    certain register configurations.

    The correct way to retrieve the index of a bit within a circuit, and any registers in that
    circuit the bit is contained within is to call :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.find_bit`.  This method
    will return the correct information in all versions of Terra since its addition in version 0.19.
