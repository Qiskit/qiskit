    Fixed an issue where :meth:`~qiskit.quantum_info.SparsePauliOp.is_unitary`
    was not properly respecting the input tolerance values when checking if an
    operator is unitary. The method now correctly uses the provided `atol` and
    `rtol` parameters when simplifying the operator and checking if it equals
    the identity. This fixes :issue:`14107`.

    This change ensures that the tolerance values passed to `is_unitary()` are
    properly propagated to the internal simplification and comparison operations,
    making the method more consistent with user expectations and other similar
    methods in Qiskit.
