    Fixed an issue where :meth:`~qiskit.quantum_info.SparsePauliOp.is_unitary`
    was not properly respecting the input tolerance values when checking if an
    operator is unitary. The method now correctly uses the provided ``atol`` and
    ``rtol`` parameters when simplifying the operator and checking if it equals
    the identity. This fixes `#14107 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/14107>`__.
