  - |
    Increased the minimum threshold for when gates are assumed to be the identity in
    :class:`.RemoveIdentityEquivalent` from machine epsilon to ``1e-12`` to
    account for round-off errors in the fidelity calculation and for consistency with the
    other classes, such as :class:`.CommutationAnalysis` and :class:`.TwoQubitWeylDecomposition`.
  - |
    Updated the metric used in :class:`.CommutationAnalysis` for matrix-based commutation checks.
    In a matrix-based check (used e.g. for non-standard gates or rotation gates with known rotation
    angles) two gates are assumed to commute if the average gate fidelity of the commutation is
    above ``1 - 1e-12``. This value is chosen to account for round-off errors in the
    fidelity calculation and for consistency with :class:`.RemoveIdentityEquivalent` and
    :class:`.TwoQubitWeylDecomposition`. See the class docstring for more information.

  - |
    Fixed an inconsistency in dealing with close-to-identity gates in the transpilation process,
    where gates that are close to the identity were assumed to commute with everything, but
    not removed. The underlying issue were different metrics used in :class:`.RemoveIdentityEquivalent`
    and :class:`.CommutationAnalysis` (and, by extension, :class:`.CommutativeInverseCancellation`).
    Both now use the average gate fidelity and the same threshold to assess whether a gate
    should be treated as identity (such as a rotation gate with very small angle). See either
    of the aforementioned classes' docstrings for more information.
    Fixed `#13547 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/13547>`__.
