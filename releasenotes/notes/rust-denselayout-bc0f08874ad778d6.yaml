    The :class:`~.DenseLayout` transpiler pass is now multithreaded, which
    greatly improves the runtime performance of the pass. By defualt it will
    use the number of of logical CPUs on your local system but you can control
    the number of threads used by the pass by  setting the
    ``RAYON_NUM_THREADS`` environment variable to an integer value. For
    example, setting ``RAYON_NUM_THREADS=4`` will run the will run the
    :class:`~.DenseLayout` with 4 threads.
