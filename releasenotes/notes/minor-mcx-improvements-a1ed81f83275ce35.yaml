    The synthesis function :func:`.synth_mcx_1_clean_b95` now produces a circuit
    with fewer layers of wrappings.

    When synthesizing an :class:`.MCXGate` gate with 3 controls, the synthesis
    functon :func:`.synth_mcx_n_dirty_i15` used to require one auxiliary qubit,
    producing a circuit with 5 qubits (3 control, 1 target, and 1 auxiliary). 
    However, the actual synthesis algorithm does not make use of this auxiliary
    qubit. This behavior is now fixed: the synthesized circuit is over 4 qubits
    (3 control and 1 target), allowing to apply the synthesis function in a
    slighty larger number of cases.
