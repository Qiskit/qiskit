    Fixed the :attr:`~.Gate.name` attribute of the :class:`.OrGate` class so
    that it now is set to ``"or"`` to uniquely identify this gate. It was
    previously incorrectly set to ``"and"`` which made it impossible to
    distinguish it from :class:`.AndGate` or have synthesis plugins to
    synthesize an :class:`.OrGate`.
