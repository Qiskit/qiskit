features_circuits:
  - |
    Added rust representation of the :class:`.QuantumRegister` and :class:`.ClassicalRegister`
    classes.
upgrade_circuits:
  - |
    Reformulate :class:`.CircuitData` to use its native representations of :class:`.Bit`, and
    :class:`.Register` as the source of truth. With this there is no longer a need to initialize
    a circuit from rust with a `py` token.
  - |
    Refactor :class:`.CircuitData`'s ``BitData`` to store registers and enables users to use
    stores bits before initializing them with python counterparts.
