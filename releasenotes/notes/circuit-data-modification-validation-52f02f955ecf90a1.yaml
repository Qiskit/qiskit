    Assignments and modifications to the ``data`` attribute of
    ``qiskit.QuantumCircuit`` objects are no validated following the same
    rules used throughout the ``QuantumCircuit`` API. This was done to
    improve the performance of the circuits API since we can now assume the
    ``data`` attribute is in a known format. If you were manually modifying
    the ``data`` attribute of a circuit object before this may no longer work
    if your modifications resulted in an data structure other than the list
    of instructions with context in the format ``[(instruction, qargs, cargs)]``
