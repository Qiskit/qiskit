    Fixed a bug in the :class:`.RemoveIdentityEquivalent` transpiler pass, where gates close
    to identity up to a global phase were removed from the circuit,
    but the global phase of the circuit was not updated. In particular,
    :class:`.RemoveIdentityEquivalent` now removes non-parameterized :class:`.GlobalPhaseGate`
    gates.
