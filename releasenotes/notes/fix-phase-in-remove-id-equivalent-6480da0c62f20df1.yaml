    Fixed a bug in :class:`.RemoveIdentityEquivalent` transpiler pass, where the
    unitary gates close to identity up to a global phase were removed from the circuit,
    but the global phase of the circuit was not updated. In particular,
    :class:`.RemoveIdentityEquivalent` now removes non-parameterized :class:`.GlobalPhaseGate`
    gates.
