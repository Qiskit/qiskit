    The :mod:`.classical_function` was removed. This module was dependent on the
    `tweedledum` library which is no longer compatible with newer versions of Python.
    As an alternative, the :class:`.PhaseOracle` and :class:`.BitFlipOracle` classes
    can be used to generate circuits from boolean expressions.
