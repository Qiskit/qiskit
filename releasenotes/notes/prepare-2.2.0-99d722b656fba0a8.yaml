    The Qiskit v2.2 release further increases the functionality and versatility of the SDK
    including enhancements for the C API and the transpiler as well as many other improvements
    and bug fixes. Some of these additions include:

      * **C API transpile function:** This version of Qiskit has added the ability for users to
        call a version of the :func:`.transpile` function directly through the C API. The
        :cpp:func:`qk_transpile` behaves similarly to the preset pass managers in Python,
        with some exceptions that are not relevant in the C context. A collection of standalone
        transpiler passes have also been added to the C API.
      
      * **Litinski transformation pass:** A new transformation pass was added to deal with circuits
        with Clifford and single qubit RZ-rotation gates. The implementation is based on the transformation
        described in `arXiv:1808.02892 <https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.02892>`__.

      * **Angle bound support for targets:** We have added support for angle bounds for parameterized angle
        rotation  within the :class:`.Target` class. When an instruction is added to the `Target` you can 
        add the optionnal argument `angle_bounds` to specify the higher and lower bounds for parameterized
        rotation gates. A transpiler pass :class:`.WrapAngles` was added to enforce the angle constraints.
      
      * **MSRV is now 1.85:** The minimum support version to buld Qiskit from source is now Rust v1.85.
        This was done due to the need of a newer version of the Rust library `faer <https://crates.io/crates/faer>`__
        and some errors happening in Windows.

    For more information about the above and other changes made, please see the release notes below
    and review the updated documentation.
