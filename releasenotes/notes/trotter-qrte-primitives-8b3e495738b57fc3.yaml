features:
  - |
    Added :class:`qiskit.algorithms.time_evolvers.trotterization.TrotterQRTE` with
    :class:`qiskit.primitives.BaseEstimator` as ``init`` parameter. It replaces
    :class:`qiskit.algorithms.TrotterQRTE`.
deprecations:
  - |
    Using :class:`qiskit.algorithms.TrotterQRTE` will now issue a
    ``PendingDeprecationWarning``. This algorithm will be deprecated in a future release and
    subsequently removed after that. This is being replaced by the new
    :class:`qiskit.algorithms.time_evolvers.trotterization.TrotterQRTE` primitive-enabled class.
