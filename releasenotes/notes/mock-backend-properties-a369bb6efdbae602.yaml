    The backends in ``qiskit.test.mock`` now contain a snapshot of real
    device calibration data. This is accessible via the ``properties()`` method
    for each backend. This can be used to test any code that depends on
    backend properties, such as noise-adaptive transpiler passes or device
    noise models for simulation. This will create a faster testing and
    development cycle without the need to go to live backends.
