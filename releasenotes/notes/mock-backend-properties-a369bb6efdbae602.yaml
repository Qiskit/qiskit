    The backends in `qiskit.test.mock` now contain a snapshot of real
    device calibration data. This is accessible via `backend.properties()`.
    This can be used to test any code that depends on backend properties,
    such as noise-adaptive transpiler passes or device noise models for
    simulation. This would create a faster testing and development cycle
    without the need to go to live backends.
