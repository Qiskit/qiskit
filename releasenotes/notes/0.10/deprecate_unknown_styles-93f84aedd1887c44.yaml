deprecations:

    When the ``mpl`` output is used for either ``qiskit.QuantumCircuit.draw()``
    or ``qiskit.visualization.circuit_drawer()`` and the ``style`` kwarg is
    used, passing in unsupported dictionary keys as part of the ``style```
    dictionary is now deprecated. Where these unknown arguments were previously
    silently ignored, in the future, unsupported keys will raise an exception.
