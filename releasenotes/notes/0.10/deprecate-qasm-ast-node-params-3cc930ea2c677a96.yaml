    Support for setting ``qiskit.circuit.Instruction`` parameters with an object
    of type ``qiskit.qasm.node.Node`` has been deprecated. ``Node`` objects that
    were previously used as parameters should be converted to a supported type
    prior to initializing a new ``Instruction`` object or calling the
    ``Instruction.params`` setter. Supported types are ``int``, ``float``,
    ``complex``, ``str``, ``qiskit.circuit.ParameterExpression``, or
    ``numpy.ndarray``.
