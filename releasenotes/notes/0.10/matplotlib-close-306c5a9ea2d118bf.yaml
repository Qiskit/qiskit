    ``matplotlib.figure.Figure`` objects returned by visualization functions
    are no longer always closed by default. Instead the returned figure objects
    are only closed if the configured matplotlib backend is an inline jupyter
    backend(either set with ``%matplotlib inline`` or
    ``%matplotlib notebook``). Output figure objects are still closed with
    these backends to avoid duplicate outputs in jupyter notebooks (which is
    why the ``Figure.close()`` were originally added).
