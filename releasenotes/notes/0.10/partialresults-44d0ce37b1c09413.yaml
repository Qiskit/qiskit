    Allows the Result class to return partial results. If a valid result schema
    is loaded that contains some experiments which succeeded and some which
    failed, this allows accessing the data from experiments that succeeded,
    while raising an exception for experiments that failed and displaying the
    appropriate error message for the failed results.
