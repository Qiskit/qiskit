deprecations:
  - |
    In the qiskit 0.9.0 release the representation of bits (both qubits and
    classical bits) changed from tuples of the form ``(register, index)`` to be
    instances of the classes ``qiskit.circuit.Qubit`` and
    ``qiskit.circuit.Clbit``. For backwards compatibility comparing
    the equality between a legacy tuple and the bit classes was supported as
    everything transitioned from tuples to being objects. This support is now
    deprecated and will be removed in the future. Everything should use the bit
    classes instead of tuples moving forward.
