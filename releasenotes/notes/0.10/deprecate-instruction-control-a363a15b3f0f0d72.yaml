deprecations:
  - |
    Using the ``control`` property of ``qiskit.circuit.Instruction`` for
    classical control is now deprecated. In the future this property will be
    used for quantum control. Classically conditioned operations will instead
    be handled by the ``condition`` property of ``qiskit.circuit.Instruction``.
