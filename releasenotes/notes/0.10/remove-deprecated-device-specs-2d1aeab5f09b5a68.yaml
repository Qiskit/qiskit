  - |
    The deprecated ``DeviceSpecification`` class has been removed. Instead you should
    use the ``PulseChannelSpec``. For example, you can run something like::

        device = pulse.PulseChannelSpec.from_backend(backend)
        device.drives[0]    # for DeviceSpecification, this was device.q[0].drive
        device.memoryslots  # this was device.mem
