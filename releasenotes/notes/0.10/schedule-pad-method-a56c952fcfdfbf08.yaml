    Introduced a new pulse command ``Delay`` which may be inserted into a pulse
    ``Schedule``. This command accepts a ``duration`` and may be added to any
    ``Channel``. Other commands may not be scheduled on a channel during a delay.

    The delay can be added just like any other pulse command. For example::

      from qiskit import pulse
      from qiskit.pulse.utils import pad

      dc0 = pulse.DriveChannel(0)

      delay = pulse.Delay(1)
      test_pulse = pulse.SamplePulse([1.0])

      sched = pulse.Schedule()
      sched += test_pulse(dc0).shift(1)

      # build padded schedule by hand
      ref_sched = delay(dc0) | sched

      # pad schedule
      padded_sched = pad(sched)

      assert padded_sched == ref_sched

    One may also pass additional channels to be padded and a time to pad until,
    for example::

      from qiskit import pulse
      from qiskit.pulse.utils import pad

      dc0 = pulse.DriveChannel(0)
      dc1 = pulse.DriveChannel(1)

      delay = pulse.Delay(1)
      test_pulse = pulse.SamplePulse([1.0])

      sched = pulse.Schedule()
      sched += test_pulse(dc0).shift(1)

      # build padded schedule by hand
      ref_sched = delay(dc0) | delay(dc1) |  sched

      # pad schedule across both channels until up until the first time step
      padded_sched = pad(sched, channels=[dc0, dc1], until=1)

      assert padded_sched == ref_sched
