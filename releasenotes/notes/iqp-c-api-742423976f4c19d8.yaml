    Added C API bindings for the Instantaneous Quantum Polynomial-time (IQP)
    circuit generator in the circuit library. The new functions
    ``qk_circuit_library_iqp`` and ``qk_circuit_library_random_iqp`` let C
    callers construct IQP circuits either from an explicit integer interaction
    matrix (with an optional symmetry check) or from a reproducible random
    instance generated in the Rust circuit library.
