fixes:
  - |
    Added a missing :attr:`.BackendV2.provider` attribute to implementations
    of the :class:`.BackendV2` abstract class. Previously, :class:`.BackendV2`
    backends could be initialized with a provider but that was not accesible
    to users.
  - |
    Fixed support for the :class:`.QuantumInstance` class when running with
    a :class:`.BackendV2` backend. Previously, attempting to use a
    :class:`.QuantumInstance` with a :class:`.BackendV2` would have resulted in
    an error.
