    Fixed an issue with the ``mpl`` backend for the circuit drawer function
    :func:`~.circuit_drawer` and the :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.draw` method
    where gates with conditions would not display properly when a sufficient
    number of gates caused the drawer to fold over to a second row.
    Fixed: `#7752 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/pull/7752>`__.
