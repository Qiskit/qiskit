    Added a new method :meth:`.DAGCircuit.copy_empty_like`
    to the :class:`~.DAGCircuit` class. This method is used to create a new
    copy of an existing :class:`.DAGCircuit` object with the
    same structure but empty of any instructions. This method is the same as
    the private method ``_copy_circuit_metadata()``, but instead is now
    part of the public API of the class.
