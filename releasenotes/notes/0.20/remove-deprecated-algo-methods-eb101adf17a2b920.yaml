    The previously deprecated methods:

    * ``qiskit.algorithms.VQE.get_optimal_cost``
    * ``qiskit.algorithms.VQE.get_optimal_circuit``
    * ``qiskit.algorithms.VQE.get_optimal_vector``
    * ``qiskit.algorithms.VQE.optimal_params``
    * ``qiskit.algorithms.HamiltonianPhaseEstimationResult.most_likely_phase``
    * ``qiskit.algorithms.PhaseEstimationResult.most_likely_phase``

    which were originally deprecated in the Qiskit Terra 0.18.0 release have
    been removed and will no longer work.

    The :class:`qiskit.algorithms.VariationalAlgorithm` class is now defined
    as an abstract base class (``ABC``) which will require classes that inherit
    from it to define both a :attr:`.VariationalAlgorithm.initial_point` getter
    and setter method.
