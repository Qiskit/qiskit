    Added a new gate class :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.XXMinusYYGate`
    to the circuit library (:mod:`qiskit.circuit.library`) for the XX-YY
    interaction. This gate can be used to implement the
    `bSwap gate <https://arxiv.org/abs/1208.1287>`__ and its powers. It also
    arises in the simulation of superconducting fermionic models.
