    Stopped the parser in :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.from_qasm_str` and
    :meth:`~.QuantumCircuit.from_qasm_file` from accepting OpenQASM programs
    that identified themselves as being from a language version other than 2.0.
    This parser is only for OpenQASM 2.0; support for imported circuits from
    OpenQASM 3.0 will be added in an upcoming release.
