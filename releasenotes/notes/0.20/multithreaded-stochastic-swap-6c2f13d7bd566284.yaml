features:
  - |
    The internals of the :class:`.StochasticSwap` algorithm have been reimplemented
    to be multithreaded and are now written in the
    `Rust <https://www.rust-lang.org/>`__ programming language instead of Cython.
    This significantly increases the run time performance of the compiler pass
    and by extension :func:`~.transpile` when run with ``optimization_level`` 0,
    1, and 2. By default the pass will use up to the number of logical CPUs on your
    local system but you can control the number of threads used by the pass by setting
    the ``RAYON_NUM_THREADS`` environment variable to an integer value. For example,
    setting ``RAYON_NUM_THREADS=4`` will run the :class:`.StochasticSwap` with 4 
    threads.

    A new environment variable ``QISKIT_FORCE_THREADS`` is available for users to
    directly control whether potentially multithreaded portions of qiskit's code
    will run in multiple threads. Currently this is only used by the
    :class:`~.StochasticSwap` transpiler pass but it likely will be used other
    parts of Qiskit in the future. When this env variable is set to ``TRUE`` any
    multithreaded code in Qiskit Terra will always use multiple threads regardless
    of any other runtime conditions that might have otherwise caused the function
    to use a single threaded variant. For example, in :class:`~.StochasticSwap` if
    the pass is being run as part of a :func:`~.transpile` call with > 1 circuit
    that is being executed in parallel with ``multiprocessing`` via
    :func:`~.parallel_map` the :class:`~.StochasticSwap` will not use multiple
    threads to avoid potentially oversubscribing CPU resources. However, if you'd
    like to use multiple threads in the pass along with multiple processes you
    can set ``QISKIT_FORCE_THREADS=TRUE``.
upgrade:
  - |
    The :class:`.StochasticSwap` transpiler pass may return different results with
    the same seed value set. This is due to the internal rewrite of the transpiler
    pass to improve runtime performance. However, this means that if you ran
    :func:`~.transpile` with ``optimization_level`` 0, 1 (the default), or 2 with a
    value set for ``seed_transpiler`` you may get an output with different swap
    mapping present after upgrading to Qiskit Terra 0.20.0.

    To build Qiskit Terra from source a `Rust <https://www.rust-lang.org/>`__
    compiler is now needed. This is due to the internal rewrite of the
    :class:`.StochasticSwap` transpiler pass which greatly improves the runtime
    performance of the transpiler. The rust compiler can easily be installed
    using rustup, which can be found here: https://rustup.rs/
issues:
  - |
    When running :func:`.parallel_map` (which is done internally by
    performance sensitive functions such as :func:`.transpile` and
    :func:`.assemble`) in a subprocess launched outside of
    :func:`.parallel_map` it is possible that the parallel dispatch performed
    inside :func:`.parallel_map` will hang and never return.
    This is due to upstream issues in cpython (see:
    https://bugs.python.org/issue40379 for more details) around the default
    method to launch subprocesses on Linux and macOS (with Python 3.7). If you
    encounter this you have two options you can either remove the nested
    parallel processes as calling :func:`.parallel_map` from a main process
    should work fine or you can manually call the cPython standard library
    ``multiprocessing`` module to perform similar parallel dispatch from a
    subprocess but use the ``"spawn"`` or ``"forkserver"`` launch methods to
    avoid the potential to have things get stuck and never return.
