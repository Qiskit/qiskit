    The :class:`~.VF2Layout` transpiler pass has a new keyword argument,
    ``target`` which is used to provide a :class:`~.Target` object for
    the pass. When specified, the :class:`~.Target` will be used by the
    pass for all information about the target device. If it is specified,
    the ``target`` option will take priority over the ``coupling_map`` and
    ``properties`` arguments.
