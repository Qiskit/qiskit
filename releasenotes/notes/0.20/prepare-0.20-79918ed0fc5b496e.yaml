  The Qiskit 0.20.0 release highlights are:

  * The introduction of multithreaded modules written in Rust to accelerate
    the performance of certain portions of Qiskit Terra and improve scaling
    with larger numbers of qubits.

  * More native support for working with a :class:`~.Target` in the transpiler.
    Several passes now support working directly with a :class:`~.Target` object
    which makes the transpiler robust in the types of backends it can target.

  * The introduction of the :mod:`qiskit.primitives` module. These APIs are
    used to provide a higher level abstraction for working with
    :class:`~.QuantumCircuit` objects and using backends for computation. For
    example, the :class:`~qiskit.primitives.BaseEstimator` defines an abstract
    interface
    for estimating an expectation value of a QuantumCircuit and an observable.
    This can then be used to construct higher level algorithms and applications
    that are built using the estimation of expectation values without having
    to worry about the implementation of computing the expectation value.

  This release no long has support for Python 3.6 with this release,
  Python 3.7 through Python 3.10.
