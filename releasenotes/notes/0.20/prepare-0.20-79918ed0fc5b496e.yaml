  The Qiskit Terra 0.20.0 release highlights are:

  * The introduction of multithreaded modules written in Rust to accelerate
    the performance of certain portions of Qiskit Terra and improve scaling
    with larger numbers of qubits. However, when building Qiskit from source a
    `Rust <https://www.rust-lang.org/>`__ compiler is now required.

  * More native support for working with a :class:`~.Target` in the transpiler.
    Several passes now support working directly with a :class:`~.Target` object
    which makes the transpiler robust in the types of backends it can target.

  * The introduction of the :mod:`qiskit.primitives` module. These APIs
    provide different abstraction levels for computing outputs of interest from
    :class:`~.QuantumCircuit` and using backends. For
    example, the :class:`~qiskit.primitives.BaseEstimator` defines an abstract
    interface for estimating an expectation value of an observable.
    This can then be used to construct higher level algorithms and applications
    that are built using the estimation of expectation values without having
    to worry about the implementation of computing the expectation value.
    This decoupling allows the implementation to improve in speed and quality
    while adhering to the defined abstract interface.
    Likewise, the :class:`~qiskit.primitives.BaseSampler` computes
    quasi-probability distributions from circuit measurements. Other primitives will
    be introduced in the future.

  This release no longer has support for Python 3.6. With this release,
  Python 3.7 through Python 3.10 are required.
fixes:
  - |
    Fixed an issue with the :class:`~.ALAPSchedule` and :class:`~.ASAPSchedule`
    transpiler passes when working with instructions that had custom pulse
    calibrations (i.e. pulse gates) set. Previously, the scheduling passes
    would not use the duration from the custom pulse calibration for thse
    instructions which would result in the an incorrect scheduling being
    generated for the circuit. This has been fixed so that now the scheduling
    passes will use the duration of the custom pulse calibration for any
    instruction in the circuit which has a custom calibration.
  - |
    Fixed support for using :class:`~.ParameterExpression` instruction
    paramaters in the :class:`~.RZXCalibrationBuilder` transpiler pass.
    Previously, if an instruction parameter included a
    bound :class:`~.ParameterExpression` the pass would not be able to
    handle this correctly.
