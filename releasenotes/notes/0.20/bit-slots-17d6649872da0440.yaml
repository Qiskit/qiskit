    The classes :class:`.Qubit`, :class:`.Clbit` and :class:`.AncillaQubit` now
    the ``__slots__`` attribute.  This is to reduce their memory usage.  As a
    side effect, they can no longer have arbitrary data attached as attributes
    to them.  This is very unlikely to have any effect on downstream code other
    than performance benefits.
