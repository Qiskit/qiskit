    Fixed an issue in the :meth:`.LocalReadoutMitigator.assignment_matrix`
    method where it would previously reject an input value for the
    ``qubits`` argument that wasn't a trivial sequence of qubits in the form:
    ``[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]``. This has been corrected so that now any list of
    qubit indices to be measured are accepted by the method.
