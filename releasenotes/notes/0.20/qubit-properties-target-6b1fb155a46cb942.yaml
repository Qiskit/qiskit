    Added a new attribute, :attr:`~.Target.qubit_properties` to the
    :class:`~.Target` class. This attribute contains a list of
    :class:`~.QubitProperties` objects for each qubit in the target.
    For example::

        target.qubit_properties[2]

    will contain the :class:`~.QubitProperties` for qubit number 2 in the
    target.

    For :class:`~.BackendV2` authors, if you were previously defining
    :class:`~.QubitProperties` directly on your :class:`~.BackendV2`
    implementation by overriding :meth:`.BackendV2.qubit_properties` this
    will still work fine. However, if you do move the definition to the 
    underlying :class:`~.Target` object and remove the specialized
    :meth:`.BackendV2.qubit_properties` implementation which will enable
    using qubit properties in the transpiler and also maintain API compatibility
    with your previous implementation.
