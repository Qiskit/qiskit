    The ``FakeBogota``, ``FakeManila``, ``FakeRome``, and ``FakeSantiago`` fake
    backends which can be found in the ``qiskit.providers.fake_provider`` module can now be
    used as backends in Pulse experiments as they now include a
    :class:`~qiskit.providers.models.PulseDefaults` created from a snapshot of
    the equivalent IBM Quantum machine's properties.
