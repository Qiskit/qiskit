    On Linux, the minimum library support has been raised from the
    `manylinux2010 VM <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0571/>`__ to
    `manylinux2014 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0599/>`__.  This mirrors
    similar changes in Numpy and Scipy.  There should be no meaningful effect
    for most users, unless your system still contains a very old version of
    ``glibc``.
