    A new pass :class:`~.DynamicalDecouplingPadding` has been added to the
    :mod:`qiskit.transpiler.passes` module. This new pass superscedes the
    existing :class:`~.DynamicalDecoupling` pass to work with the new
    scheduling workflow in the transpiler. It is a subclass of the
    :class:`~.BasePadding` pass and depends on having scheduling and alignment
    analysis passes run prior to it in a :class:`~.PassManager`.
    This new pass can take a ``pulse_alignment`` argument which represents a
    hardware constraint for waveform start timing. The spacing between gates
    comprising a dynamical decoupling sequence is now adjusted to satisfy this
    constraint so that the circuit can be executed on hardware with the constraint.
    This value is usually found in :attr:`.BackendConfiguration.timing_constraints`.
    Additionally the pass also has an ``extra_slack_distribution`` option has been
    to control how to distribute the extra slack when the duration of the
    created dynamical decoupling sequence is shorter than the idle time of your circuit
    that you want to fill with the sequence. This defaults to ``middle`` which is
    identical to conventional behavior. The new strategy ``split_edges``
    evenly divide the extra slack into the beginning and end of the sequence,
    rather than adding it to the interval in the middle of the sequence.
    This might result in better noise cancellation especially when ``pulse_alignment`` > 1.
