    The internal computations of :meth:`.Statevector.expectation_value` and
    :meth:`.DensityMatrix.expectation_value` methods have been reimplemented
    in the Rust programming language. This new implementation is multithreaded
    and by default for a :class:`~.Statevector` or :class:`~.DensityMatrix`
    >= 19 qubits will spawn a thread pool with the number of logical CPUs
    available on the local system. You can you can control the number of
    threads used by setting the ``RAYON_NUM_THREADS`` environment variable to
    an integer value. For example, setting ``RAYON_NUM_THREADS=4`` will only
    use 4 threads in the thread pool.
