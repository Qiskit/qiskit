    The :meth:`~qiskit.quantum_info.Pauli.evolve` method of the
    :class:`qiskit.quantum_info.Pauli` and :class:`qiskit.quantum_info.PauliList`
    classes now has a new keyword argument, ``frame``, which is used to
    perform an evolution of a Pauli by a Clifford. If ``frame='h'`` (default)
    then it does the Heisenberg picture evolution of a Pauli by a Clifford,
    and if ``frame='s'`` then it does the Schr√∂dinger picture evolution of a
    Pauli by a Clifford. The latter option yields a faster calculation, and is
    also useful in certain cases. This new option makes the calculation of the
    greedy Clifford decomposition method in
    :class:`qiskit.quantum_info.decompose_clifford` significantly faster.
