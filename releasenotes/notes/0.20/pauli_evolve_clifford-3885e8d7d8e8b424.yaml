    The methods :meth:`.Pauli.evolve` and :meth:`.PauliList.evolve`
    now have a new keyword argument, ``frame``, which is used to
    perform an evolution of a Pauli by a Clifford. If ``frame='h'`` (default)
    then it does the Heisenberg picture evolution of a Pauli by a Clifford
    (:math:`P' = C^\dagger P C`), and if ``frame='s'`` then it does the
    Schr√∂dinger picture evolution of a Pauli by a Clifford
    (:math:`P' = C P C^\dagger`). The latter option yields a faster calculation,
    and is also useful in certain cases. This new option makes the calculation
    of the greedy Clifford decomposition method in :class:`.decompose_clifford`
    significantly faster.
