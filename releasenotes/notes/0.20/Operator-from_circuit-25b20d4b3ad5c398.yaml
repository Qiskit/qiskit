    Added a new constructor method for the :class:`.Operator` class,
    :meth:`.Operator.from_circuit` for creating a new :class:`.Operator`
    object from a :class:`.QuantumCircuit`. While this was possible normally
    using the default constructor, the :meth:`.Operator.from_circuit` method
    provides additional options to adjust how the operator is created. Primarily
    this lets you permute the qubit order based on a set :class:`.Layout`. For,
    example::

      from qiskit.circuit import QuantumCircuit
      from qiskit import transpile
      from qiskit.transpiler import CouplingMap
      from qiskit.quantum_info import Operator

      circuit = QuantumCircuit(3)
      circuit.h(0)
      circuit.cx(0, 1)
      circuit.cx(1, 2)

      cmap = CouplingMap.from_line(3)
      out_circuit = transpile(circuit, initial_layout=[2, 1, 0], coupling_map=cmap)
      operator = Operator.from_circuit(out_circuit)

    the ``operator`` variable will have the qubits permuted based on the
    layout so that it is identical to what is returned by ``Operator(circuit)``
    before transpilation.
