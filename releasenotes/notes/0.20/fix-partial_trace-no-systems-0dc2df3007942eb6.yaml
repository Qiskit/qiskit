    Fixed an issue with the :func:`.quantum_info.partial_trace` when the
    function was asked to trace out *no* subsystems, it will now correctly
    return the :class:`.DensityMatrix` of the input state with all dimensions
    remaining rather than throwing an error.
    Fixed `#7613 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/7612>`__
