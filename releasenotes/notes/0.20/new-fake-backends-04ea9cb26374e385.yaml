    New fake backend classes are available under ``qiskit.providers.fake_provider``. These
    include mocked versions of ``ibm_cairo``, ``ibm_hanoi``,
    ``ibmq_kolkata``, ``ibm_nairobi``, and ``ibm_washington``. As with the other fake backends,
    these include snapshots of calibration and error data taken from the real
    system, and can be used for local testing, compilation and simulation.
