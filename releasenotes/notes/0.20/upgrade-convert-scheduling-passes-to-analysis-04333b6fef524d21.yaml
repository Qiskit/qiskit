    A new transpiler pass :class:`.PadDelay` has been added. This pass fills
    idle time on the qubit wires with :class:`~.circuit.Delay` instructions.
    This pass is part of the new workflow for scheduling passes in the
    transpiler and depends on a scheduling analysis pass (such as
    :class:`~.ALAPScheduleAnalysis` or :class:`~ASAPScheduleAnalysis`) and
    any alignment passes (such as :class:`~.ConstrainedReschedule`) to be
    run prior to :class:`.PadDelay`.
