    Added new fake backend classes from snapshots of the IBM Quantum systems
    based on the :class:`~.BackendV2` interface and provides a
    :class:`~qiskit.transpiler.Target` for each backend. :class:`~.BackendV2`
    based versions of all the existing backends are added except for three old
    backends ``FakeRueschlikon``, ``FakeTenerfie`` and ``FakeTokyo`` as they
    do not have snapshots files available which are required for creating
    a new fake backend class based on :class:`~.BackendV2`.

    These new V2 fake backends will enable testing and development of new
    features introduced by :class:`~qiskit.providers.backend.BackendV2` and
    :class:`~qiskit.transpiler.Target` such as improving the transpiler.
