    The :func:`~.plot_gate_map` visualization function and the functions built
    on top of it, :func:`~.plot_error_map` and :func:`~.plot_circuit_layout`,
    have a new keyword argument, ``qubit_coordinates``. This argument takes
    a sequence of 2D coordinates to use for plotting each qubit in the backend
    being visualized. If specified this sequence must have a length equal to
    the number of qubits on the backend and it will be used instead of the 
    default behavior.

    The :func:`~.plot_gate_map` visualization function and the functions built
    on top of it, :func:`~.plot_error_map` and :func:`~.plot_circuit_layout`,
    now are able to plot any backend not just those with the number of qubits
    equal to one of the IBM backends. This relies on
    the retworkx ``spring_layout()``
    `function <https://qiskit.org/documentation/retworkx/apiref/retworkx.spring_layout.html>`__
    to generate the layout for the visualization. If the default layout doesn't
    work with a backend's particular coupling graph you can use the
    ``qubit_coordinates`` function to set a custom layout.

    The :func:`~.plot_gate_map` visualization function and the functions built
    on top of it, :func:`~.plot_error_map` and :func:`~.plot_circuit_layout`,
    are now able to function with a :class:`~.BackendV2` based backend.
    Previously, these functions only worked with :class:`~.BaseBackend` or
    :class:`~.BackendV1` based backends.
