    Fixed an issue where the :meth:`.HHL.construct_circuit` method under
    certain conditions would not return a correct
    :class:`~.QuantumCircuit`. Previously, the function had a rounding error in
    calculating how many qubits were necessary to represent the eigenvalues
    which would cause an incorrect circuit output.
