features:
  - |
    Several lazy dependency checkers have been added to the new module
    :mod:`qiskit.utils.optionals`, which can be used to query if certain Qiskit
    functionality is available.  For example, you can ask if Qiskit has detected
    the presence of ``matplotlib`` by asking
    ``if qiskit.utils.optionals.HAS_MATPLOTLIB``.  These objects only attempt to
    import their dependencies when they are queried, so you can use them in
    runtime code without affecting import time.
  - |
    Import time for :mod:`qiskit` has been significantly improved, especially
    for those with many of Qiskit Terra's optional dependencies installed.
upgrade:
  - |
    The error raised by :class:`.HoareOptimizer` if the optional dependency
    ``z3`` is not available has changed from :class:`.TranspilerError` to
    :class:`.MissingOptionalLibraryError` (which is both a :class:`.QiskitError`
    and an ``ImportError``).  This was done to be consistent with the other
    optional dependencies.
