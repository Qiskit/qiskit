    Fixed an issue with the ``text`` backend for the circuit drawer function
    :func:`~.circuit_drawer` and the :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.draw` method
    when gates that use side text, such as the :class:`~.CPhaseGate` and
    :class:`~.RZZGate` gate classes, with classical conditions set would not
    display properly.
    Fixed `#7532 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/7532>`__.
