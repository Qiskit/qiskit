    The :class:`~.InstructionDurations` class now has support for working
    with parameters of an instruction. Each entry in an
    :class:`~.InstructionDurations` object now consists of a tuple of
    ``(inst_name, qubits, duration, parameters, unit)``. This enables an
    :class:`~.InstructionDurations` to define durations for an instruction
    given a certain parameter value to account for different durations with
    different parameter values on an instruction that takes a numeric parameter.
