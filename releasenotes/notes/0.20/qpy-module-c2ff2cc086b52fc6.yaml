    New module :mod:`qiskit.qpy` has beend added. This functionality for
    saving and loading :class:`QuantumCircuit` has been existing
    in :mod:`qiskit.circuit.qpy_serialization` but now code is moved to its own module.
    This change is aiming at QPY serializing different data types that Qiskit generates,
    such as pulse schedules attached to the pulse gates.
