    The module ``qiskit.circuit.library.probability_distributions`` has been
    removed and no longer exists as per the deprecation notice from qiskit-terra
    0.17.0 (released Apr 1, 2021).  The affected classes are
    ``UniformDistribution``, ``NormalDistribution``, and
    ``LogNormalDistribution``. They are all moved to qiskit-finance, into the
    circuit library module
    ``qiskit_finance.circuit.library.probability_distributions``.
