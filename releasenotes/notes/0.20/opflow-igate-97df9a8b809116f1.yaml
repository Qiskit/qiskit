fixes:
  - |
    An opflow expression containing the Pauli identity ``opflow.I`` no longer
    produces an :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.IGate` when converted to a circuit. 
    This change fixes a difference in expectation; the identity gate in the circuit indicates 
    a delay however in opflow we expect a mathematical identity -- meaning no operation at all.
  - |
    The :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.PauliGate` no longer inserts an 
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.IGate` for Paulis with the label ``"I"``.
