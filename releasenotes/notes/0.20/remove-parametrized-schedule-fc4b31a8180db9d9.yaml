    The previously deprecated ``ParametrizedSchedule`` class has been removed
    and no longer exists. This class was deprecated as a part of the 0.17.0
    release. Instead of using this class you can directly parametrize
    :py:class:`~qiskit.pulse.Schedule` or
    :py:class:`~qiskit.pulse.ScheduleBlock` objects by specifying a
    :py:class:`~qiskit.circuit.Parameter` object to the parametric pulse
    argument.
