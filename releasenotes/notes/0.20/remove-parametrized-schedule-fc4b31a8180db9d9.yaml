    ``ParametrizedSchedule`` has been removed and no longer exist.
    This class was deprecated as a part of the 0.17.0 release.
    Now you can directly parametrize :py:class:`~qiskit.pulse.schedule.Schedule` or
    :py:class:`~qiskit.pulse.schedule.ScheduleBlock` by specifying
    :py:class:`~qiskit.circuit.parameter.Parameter` object to the parametric pulse argument.
