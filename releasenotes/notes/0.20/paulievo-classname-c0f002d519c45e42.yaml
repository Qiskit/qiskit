  - |
    The :attr:`~.PauliEvolutionGate.name` attribute of the
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.PauliEvolutionGate` class has been changed
    to always be ``"PauliEvolution"``. This change was made to be consistent
    with other gates in Qiskit and enables other parts of Qiskit to quickly
    identify when a particular operation in a circuit is a
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.PauliEvolutionGate`. For example,
    it enables the unrolling to Pauli evolution gates.

    Previously, the name contained the operators which are evolved, which is
    now available via the :attr:`.PauliEvolutionGate.label` attribute.
    If a circuit with a :class:`~.PauliEvolutionGate` is drawn, the gate will
    still show the same information, which gates are being evolved.
