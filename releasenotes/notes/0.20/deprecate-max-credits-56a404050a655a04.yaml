deprecations:
  - |
    The ``max_credits`` argument to :func:`~.execute_function.execute`, and all
    of the ``Qobj`` configurations (e.g. :class:`.QasmQobjConfig` and
    :class:`.PulseQobjConfig`), is deprecated and will be removed in a future
    release.  The credit system has not been in use on IBM Quantum backends for
    two years, and the option has no effect.  No alternative is necessary.
    For example, if you were calling :func:`~.execute_function.execute` as::

        job = execute(qc, backend, shots=4321, max_credits=10)

    you can simply omit the ``max_credits`` argument::

        job = execute(qc, backend, shots=4321)
