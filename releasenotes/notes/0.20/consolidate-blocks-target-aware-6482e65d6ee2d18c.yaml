features:
  - |
    The :class:`~qiskit.transpiler.passes.ConsolidateBlocks` pass has a new
    keyword argument on its constructor, ``target``. This argument is used to
    specify a :class:`~qiskit.transpiler.Target` object representing the
    compilation target for the pass. If it is specified it supersedes the
    ``basis_gates`` kwarg. If a target is specified, the pass will respect the
    gates and qubits for the instructions defined in the
    :class:`~qiskit.transpiler.Target` when deciding which gates to consolidate
    into a unitary.
  - |
    The :class:`~qiskit.transpiler.Target` class has a new method,
    :meth:`~qiskit.transpiler.Target.instruction_supported` which is used
    to query the target to see if an instruction (the combination of an
    operation and the qubit(s) it is executed on) is supported on the backend
    modelled by the :class:`~qiskit.transpiler.Target`.
