  - |
    The previous :class:`qiskit.test.mock.fake_mumbai_v2.FakeMumbaiV2` class
    has been renamed to ``FakeMumbaiFractionalCX`` to differentiate it from
    the :class:`~.BackendV2` based fake backend for the IBM Mumbai device,
    :class:`qiskit.test.mock.backends.FakeMumbaiV2`. If you were previously
    relying on the :class:`~qiskit.test.mock.fake_mumbai_v2.FakeMumbaiV2` class
    to get a fake backend that had fractional applications of :class:`~.CXGate`
    defined in its target you need to use ``FakeMumbaiFractionalCX`` class
    as the :class:`~qiskit.test.mock.backends.FakeMumbaiV2` will no longer
    have those extra gate definitions in its :class:`~.Target`.
