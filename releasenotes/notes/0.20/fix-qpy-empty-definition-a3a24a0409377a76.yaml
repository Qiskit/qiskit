    Fixed QPY serialisation of custom instructions which had an explicit no-op
    definition.  Previously these would be written and subsequently read the
    same way as if they were opaque gates (with no given definition).  They will
    now correctly round-trip an empty definition.  For example, the following
    will now be correct::

        import io
        from qiskit.circuit import Instruction, QuantumCircuit, qpy_serialization

        # This instruction is explicitly defined as a one-qubit gate with no
        # operations.
        empty = QuantumCircuit(1, name="empty").to_instruction()
        # This instruction will perform some operations that are only known
        # by the hardware backend.
        opaque = Instruction("opaque", 1, 0, [])

        circuit = QuantumCircuit(2)
        circuit.append(empty, [0], [])
        circuit.append(opaque, [1], [])

        qpy_file = io.BytesIO()
        qpy_serialization.dump(circuit, qpy_file)
        qpy_file.seek(0)
        new_circuit = qpy_serialization.load(qpy_file)[0]

        # Previously both instructions in `new_circuit` would now be opaque, but
        # there is now a correct distinction.
        circuit == new_circuit
