    Using an odd integer for the ``order`` argument on the constructor of the
    :class:`~.qiskit.synthesis.SuzukiTrotter` class is deprecated and will
    no longer work in a future release. The product formulae used by the
    :class:`~.qiskit.synthesis.SuzukiTrotter` are only defined when the order
    is even as the Suzuki product formulae is symmetric.
