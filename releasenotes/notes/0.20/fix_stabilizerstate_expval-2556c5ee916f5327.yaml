    Fixed an issue in the :class:`.StabilizerState.expectation_value`
    methodexpectation value calculation, where the output expectation value
    would be incorrect if the input :class:`~.Pauli` operator for the ``oper``
    argument had a non-trivial phase.
    Fixed `#7441 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/7441>`__
