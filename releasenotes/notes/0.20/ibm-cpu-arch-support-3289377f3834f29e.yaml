    Added partial support for running on ppc64le and s390x Linux platforms.
    This release will start publishing pre-compiled binaries for ppc64le and
    s390x Linux platforms on all Python versions. However, unlike other
    supported platforms not all of Qiskit's upstream dependencies support these
    platforms yet. So a C/C++ compiler may be required to build and install
    these dependencies and a simple ``pip install qiskit-terra`` with just a
    working Python environment will not be sufficient to install Qiskit.
    Additionally, these same constraints prevent us from testing the
    pre-compiled wheels before publishing them, so the same guarantees around
    platform support that exist for the other platforms don't apply here.
