    New pass :class:`SetIOLatency` has been added. This pass takes
    ``clbit_write_latency`` and ``conditional_latency`` and set these values to
    property set of the pass manager.
    Following passes that perform scheduling on instruction acting on classical resgisters
    may consider these classical I/O latencies to provide more presice scheduling on
    dynamic circuit.
