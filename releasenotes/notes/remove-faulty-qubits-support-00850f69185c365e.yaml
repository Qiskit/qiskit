    When running the :func:`~.transpile` function with a :class:`~.BackendV1`
    based backend or a :class:`~.BackendProperties` via the ``backend_properties``
    keyword argument that has any qubits or gates flagged as faulty the function
    will no longer try to automatically remap the qubits based on this information.
    The method by which :func:`~.transpile` attempted to do this remapping was
    fundamentally flawed and in most cases of such a backend it would result
    an internal error being raised. In practice very few backends ever set the
    fields in :class:`~.BackendProperties` to flag a qubit or gate as faulty.
    If you were somehow successfully relying on :func:`~.transpile to do this
    re-mapping for you will now need to manually do that and pass a
    mapped input to the ``coupling_map`` and ``backend_properties`` arguments
    which has filtered out the faulty qubits and gates and then manually re-map
    the output.
