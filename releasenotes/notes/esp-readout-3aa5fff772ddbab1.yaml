    Support for Excited State Promoted (ESP) readout from Qiskit has been added. ESP readout
    discriminates between ``|0>`` and higher order energy states of transmon qubits in order to
    improve readout fidelity. Further details may be found
    `here <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.08571.pdf>`_.

    To check whether the backend supports ESP readout, one can query::

        measure_esp_enabled = getattr(backend.configuration(), "measure_esp_enabled", False)

    If the flag ``measure_esp_enabled`` is not in the backend configuration, we return ``False``
    by default.

    A user can request usage of ESP readout via the ``use_measure_esp`` flag in
    :meth:`~qiskit.compiler.assemble`. This tells the backend to use ESP readout on the final
    measurement of each circuit. This is done via::

        qobj = assemble(circ, backend, use_measure_esp=True)

    If ``measure_esp_enabled=False`` and ``use_measure_esp=True``, a ``QiskitError`` is raised. If
    ``use_measure_esp`` is not set, it will default to the value of ``measure_esp_enabled``.
