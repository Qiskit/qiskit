    New pulse base class :class:`~SymbolicPulse` has been added. This is a
    replacement of the conventional :class:`~ParametricPulse` which will be deprecated.
    In new base class, pulse envelope and parameter validation functions are
    represented by symbolic expression objects, which are lambidfied immediately when
    corresponding methods are called for the first time.
    The new class provides a self-contained and portable pulse data since these symbolic equations
    can be easily serialized through symbolic computation libraries.
    QPY serialization support of these pulses is planned.
upgrade:
  - |
    Importing pulse class from ``qiskit.pulse.library.*`` now import :class:`~SymbolicPulse`
    subclass rather than :class:`~ParametricPulse` subclass.
    There are same set of pulse subclass in the symbolic pulse module,
    :class:`~qiskit.pulse.library.Gaussian`,
    :class:`~qiskit.pulse.library.GaussianSquare`,
    :class:`~qiskit.pulse.library.Drag`, and
    :class:`~qiskit.pulse.library.Constant`.
    Becasue :class:`~SymbolicPulse` supports full backward compatibility,
    there is no loss of functionality due to the switching of the base class.
