    The :meth:`.CouplingMap.__eq__`` method has been updated to check that the edge lists of the
    underlying graphs contain the same elements. Under the assumption that the underlying graphs are
    connected, this check additionally ensures that the graphs have the same number of nodes with
    the same labels. Any code using ``CouplingMap() == CouplingMap()`` to check object equality
    should be updated to ``CouplingMap() is CouplingMap()``.
