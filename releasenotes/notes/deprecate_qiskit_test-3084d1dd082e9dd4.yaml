deprecations:
  - |
    The module ``qiskit.test`` is deprecated. This module is tooling and helpers for testing Qiskit
    internally and most of its functionality had been moved or is not used in Qiskit any more.
    In practice, the module was never meant to be used externally. If any of the code in the module
    is absolutely necessary beyond Qiskit, consider copying that code out into your own test infrastructure.
