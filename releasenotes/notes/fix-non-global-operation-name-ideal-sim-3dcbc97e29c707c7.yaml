fixes:
  - |
    Fixed an issue with the :meth:`.Target.get_non_global_operation_names`
    method when running on a target incorrectly raising an exception on targets
    with ideal global operations. Previously, if this method was called on a
    target that contained any ideal globally defined operations, where the
    instruction properties are set to ``None``, this method would raise an
    exception instead of treating that instruction as global.
  - |
    Fixed an issue with the :func:`~qiskit.compiler.transpile` function where
    it could fail when being passed a :class:`.Target` object directly with the
    ``target`` kwarg.
  - |
    Fixed an issue with the :func:`~qiskit.compiler.transpile` function where
    it could fail when the ``backend`` argument was a :class:`.BackendV2`
    or a :class:`.Target` via the ``target`` kwarg that contained ideal
    globally defined operations.
