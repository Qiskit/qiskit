    Fixed an issue with the :meth:`.Target.get_non_global_operation_names`
    method when running on a target incorrectly raising an exception on targets
    with ideal global operations. Previously, if this method was called on a
    target that contained any ideal globally defined operations, where the
    instruction properties are set to ``None``, this method would raise an
    exception instead of treating that instruction as global.
