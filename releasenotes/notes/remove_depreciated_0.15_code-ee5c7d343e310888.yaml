    Removed the argument `rho` in :func:`~qiskit.visualization.plot_state_hinton`,
    :func:`~qiskit.visualization.plot_bloch_multivector`,
    :func:`~qiskit.visualization.plot_state_city`, :func:`~qiskit.visualization.plot_state_paulivec`,
    and :func:`~qiskit.visualization.plot_state_qsphere`. That argument was replaced by `state`.
    Removed `qiskit.scheduler.utils` as all contained functions were moved to
    `qiskit.pulse.macros` and `qiskit.pulse.utils`.
    All these were deprecated since 0.15 (released on August 06, 2020) and now they are removed.
