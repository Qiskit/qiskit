    Added a new option, ``fallback_on_default``, to :class:`.UnitarySynthesis`
    transpiler pass. This option applies when the pass is called with a
    non-default synthesis plugin, specified via the argument ``method``.

    By default, the result of synthesizing a unitary matrix in the circuit
    is obtained by running the plugin on the unitary (provided the plugin
    applies; for instance, the plugin is not run if it does not support the
    number of qubits over which the unitary is defined). However, when 
    ``fallback_on_default`` is set to ``True``, the pass checks whether the
    plugin successfully and correctly synthesized the unitary - that is, the
    returned circuit is not ``None`` and conforms to the target. If not,
    the unitary is synthesized using the :class:`~.DefaultUnitarySynthesis`
    plugin.
    
    This is useful for instance in the CLifford+T transpilation pipeline, where
    users may want to write custom synthesis plugins but still fall back on
    predefined synthesis methods when the circuit produced by the custom plugin
    does not conform to the Clifford+T basis set.
