    The :class:`.TwoQubitWeylDecomposition` synthesis class has been rewritten
    in Rust for better performance.
upgrade_synthesis:
  - |
    The :class:`.TwoQubitWeylDecomposition` no longer will self specialize into
    a subclass on creation. This was an internal detail of the :class:`.TwoQubitWeylDecomposition`
    previously, and was not a documented public behavior as all the subclasses behaved
    the same and were only used for internal dispatch. However, as it was discoverable
    behavior this release note is to document that this will no longer occur and all
    instances of :class:`.TwoQubitWeylDecomposition` will be of the same type. There is no
    change in behavior for public methods of the class.
