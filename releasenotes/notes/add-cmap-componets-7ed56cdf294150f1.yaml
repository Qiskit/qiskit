features:
  - |
    Added support to the :class:`~.CouplingMap` object to have a disjoint
    connectivity. Previously, a :class:`~.CouplingMap` could only be
    constructed if the graph was connected. This will enable using
    :class:`~.CouplingMap` to represent hardware with disjoint qubits.
  - |
    Added a new method :meth:`.CouplingMap.components` which
    is used to get a list of :class:`~.CouplingMap` component subgraphs for
    a disjoint :class:`~.CouplingMap`. If the :class:`~.CouplingMap` object
    is connected this will just return a single :class:`~.CouplingMap`
    equivalent to the original.
