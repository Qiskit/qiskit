    Added the :class:`.SolovayKitaev` transpiler pass to run the Solovay-Kitaev algorithm for
    approximating single-qubit unitaries using a discrete gate set. In combination with the basis
    translator, this allows to convert any unitary circuit to a universal discrete gate set,
    which could be implemented fault-tolerantly.

    This pass can e.g. be used after compiling to U and CX gates:

    .. jupyter-execute::

      from qiskit import transpile
      from qiskit.circuit.library import QFT
      from qiskit.transpiler.passes.synthesis import SolovayKitaev

      qft = QFT(3)

      # optimize to general 1-qubit unitaries and CX
      transpiled = transpile(qft, basis_gates=["u", "cx"], optimization_level=1)

      skd = SolovayKitaev()  # uses T Tdg and H as default basis
      discretized = skd(transpiled)

      print(discretized.count_ops())

    The decomposition can also be used with the unitary synthesis plugin, as
    the "sk" method on the :class:`~.UnitarySynthesis` transpiler pass:

    .. jupyter-execute::

        from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
        from qiskit.quantum_info import Operator
        from qiskit.transpiler.passes import UnitarySynthesis

        circuit = QuantumCircuit(1)
        circuit.rx(0.8, 0)
        unitary = Operator(circuit).data

        unitary_circ = QuantumCircuit(1)
        unitary_circ.unitary(unitary, [0])

        synth = UnitarySynthesis(basis_gates=["h", "s"], method="sk")
        out = synth(unitary_circ)

        out.draw('mpl')
