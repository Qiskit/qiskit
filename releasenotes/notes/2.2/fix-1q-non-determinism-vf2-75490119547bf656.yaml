    Fixed an issue in the :class:`.VF2Layout` transpiler pass where even with
    a fixed seed set the output from the pass was potentially non-deterministic;
    specifically if the input circuit had any active qubits that only contained
    single qubit operations.
    Fixed `#14729 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/14729>`__
