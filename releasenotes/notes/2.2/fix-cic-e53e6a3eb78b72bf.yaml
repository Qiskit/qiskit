    Fixed several problems in the :class:`.CommutativeInverseCancellation`
    transpiler pass: the pass now works correctly on circuits containing
    :class:`.Clifford` operations, control-flow operations, and non-invertible
    operations such as :class:`.Initialize`.

    In addition, the pass now always first performs a syntactic (non-matrix-based)
    check when identifying inverse gate pairs. If the gates are not syntactically
    equal, the argument ``matrix_based`` is set to ``True``, and the operation
    does not act on more than ``max_qubits`` qubits, then a matrix-based check
    is also performed. This slightly improves the reduction potential of the pass.
