features_qpy:
  - |
    Introduced QPY format version 16. This new version introduces a new circuit start table
    to the file header which contains the byte offsets of the start of each circuit in a QPY
    file. This allows for a potentially more efficient loading of circuits from QPY files,
    and a potentially multi-threaded Rust implementation in the future. Additionally, the
    new format version adds support for the new ``DURATION`` variant of picoseconds.

upgrade_qpy:
  - |
    The default version of QPY emitted by :func:`.qpy.dump` is now QPY format version 16. If
    you require a different format version you can use the ``version`` argument to specify an
    earlier format version.
