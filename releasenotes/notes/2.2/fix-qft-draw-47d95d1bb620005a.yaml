    Fixed an edge case in the display of the :class:`.QFT` circuit.
    Previously, when :meth:`.QFT.inverse` was called and then the attributes of the QFT circuit
    were modified, the QFT was displayed as ``"IQFT_dg"``. This was incorrect, and now
    it correctly shows ``"IQFT"``.
    Fixed `#14758 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/14758>`__.
