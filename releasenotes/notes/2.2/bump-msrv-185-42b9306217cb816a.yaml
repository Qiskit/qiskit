    The minimum support Rust version for building Qiskit from source (including
    building the C API in standalone mode) has been increased from Rust 1.79 to
    Rust 1.85. This change was necessary to enable using a newer version of the
    Rust linear algebra library `faer <https://crates.io/crates/faer>`__ that is
    used inside Qiskit. There were issues identified when running Qiskit on
    Windows with the previous version of faer. These were fixed in the newer
    release, however a newer version of the Rust compiler is required to build
    the newer version of faer.
