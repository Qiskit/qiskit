    Custom subclasses of :class:`.BasePassManager` can now modify their
    :attr:`~.BasePassManager.property_set` attribute during their :meth:`~.BasePassManager._passmanager_frontend`
    method, to seed initial properties.  This provides symmetry, as it was previously only possible
    to read the final properties during :meth:`~.BasePassManager._passmanager_backend`.

    The circuit :class:`.PassManager` now always sets the properties ``original_circuit_indices``
    and ``num_input_qubits`` before execution starts on individual passes.  These are properties of
    the input circuit, which it was previously up to individual passes to set, often as a side
    effect of their primary purpose.
