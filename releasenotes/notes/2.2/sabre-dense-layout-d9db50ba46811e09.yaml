    :class:`.SabreLayout` uses a "dense subset" layout as one of its trials, following the same
    algorithm as :class:`.DenseLayout`.  Previously, however, the version used by Sabre was assigning
    all virtual qubits, including dummy ancillas, to a physical qubit, compromising the effectiveness
    of the algorithm, but not its correctness.  Sabre will now only use the virtual qubits defined by
    the user for this initial trial, which may result in small improvements in layout selection
    when averaged over large classes of circuit.
