    Added a new standalone transpiler pass function
    :cpp:func:`qk_transpiler_pass_standalone_commutative_cancellation` which is for
    running the :class:`.CommutativeCancellation` transpiler pass. Calling this
    function in C is equivalent to running the pass in Python like::

        CommutativeCancellation(..)(circuit)
