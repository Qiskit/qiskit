    :class:`.DAGCircuit` now has a manual implementation of :meth:`~object.__deepcopy__`.  This is
    orders of magnitude faster than the previous implicit implementation from the pickle protocol,
    especially for large circuits. This also directly benefits compilation performance when running
    :func:`.transpile` or running the preset pass managers returned by
    :func:`.generate_preset_pass_manager` at ``optimization_level=3`` as optimization level 3
    internally deep copies the :class:`.DAGCircuit` for each iteration of the optimization loop
    in the ``optimization`` stage.
