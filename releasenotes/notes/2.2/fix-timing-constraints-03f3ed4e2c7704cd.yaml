    Fixed an issue with the :func:`.generate_preset_pass_manager` function
    where it would incorrectly ignore the timing constraints data contained
    in a :class:`.Target` object provided when the ``backend`` argument was
    not set.
    Fixed `#14329 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/14329>`__
