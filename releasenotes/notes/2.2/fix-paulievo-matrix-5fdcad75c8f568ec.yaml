    The :meth:`.PauliEvolutionGate.to_matrix` method now returns the exact matrix
    exponential :math:`\exp(-it H)`, where :math:`H` is the ``operator`` and :math:`t`
    the ``time`` passed to the gate. This fixes an unexpected behavior, since the
    :class:`.PauliEvolutionGate` is documented to represent the *exact* time evolution,
    but previously the matrix was dependent on how the compiler approximates the
    time evolution. The ``to_matrix`` method is now consistent with the documentation.
