    The Qiskit v2.2 adds several enhancements for the C API and the transpiler as well as many other improvements
    and bug fixes. The major features of this new release are:

      * **C API transpile function:** The C API now includes a function for transpiling a
        quantum circuit: :cpp:func:`qk_transpile`. This function is equivalent to the Python
        :func:`.transpile` function for a standalone C context.

      * **Litinski transformation pass:** A new transformation pass :class:`.LitinskiTransformation` that implements
        the transform described `arXiv:1808.02892 <https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.02892>`__. This is pass is typically used
        in compilation for fault tolerant architectures.

      * **Angle bound support for targets:** The :class:`.Target` class now supports specifying bounds for the allowed
        values for parameterized operations added to the target. When an instruction is added to the :class:`.Target` you
        can add the optional argument `angle_bounds` to specify the higher and lower bounds for parameterized
        rotation gates. A new transpiler pass :class:`.WrapAngles` was added to enforce the angle constraints as part
        of a transpilation pipeline.

    The v2.2 release series is the final minor release series with support Python 3.9. The minimum supported Rust version
    use to build Qiskit from source is now Rust v1.85, raised from 1.79 in 2.1.0.

    For more information about the above and other changes made, please see the release notes below
    and review the updated documentation.
