    Added a new synthesis algorithm, :func:`.synth_mcx_noaux_hp24`, for :class:`.MCXGate`
    that does not require any auxiliary qubits. This method produces a linear rather
    than a quadratic number of CX gates compared to the existing :func:`synth_mcx_noaux_v24`
    algorithm. In particular, the new method is better when the number of control qubits
    is greater than 5. The algorithm is based on the paper "Compiling Conditional Quantum
    Gates without Using Helper Qubits" by Huang and Palsberg
    (https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3656436).

    Added a new high-level synthesis plugin :class:`.MCXSynthesisNoAuxHP24` for
    :class:`.MCXGate` objects. Furthermore, the default synthesis plugin
    :class:`.MCXSynthesisDefault` for :class:`.MCXGate` objects was updated to
    always choose the best synthesis method depending on the available number of
    auxiliary qubits.
