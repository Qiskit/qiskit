    Added a setting named ``min_qpy_version`` in the user configuration file. When set, it defines the minimum allowed QPY version
    for :func:`.qpy.load`. If the format version of a QPY file is lower than the ``minimum_qpy_version``
    than the ``minimum_qpy_version`` setting it will raise an exception.
