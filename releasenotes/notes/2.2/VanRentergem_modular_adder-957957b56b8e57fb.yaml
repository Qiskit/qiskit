features_synthesis:
  - |
    Added new synthesis algorithm for :class:`.ModularAdderGate` that requires no ancillary qubits
    and has better CX count compared to :func:`.adder_qft_d00`:

    * :func:`.adder_modular_v17`

features_transpiler:
  - |
    Added new high-level-synthesis plugin for synthesizing a :class:`.ModularAdderGate`:

    * :class:`.ModularAdderSynthesisV17`, based on :func:`.adder_modular_v17`.

    The :class:`.ModularAdderSynthesisDefault` has also been updated to follow the following sequence
    of modular adder synthesizers: ``"ModularAdder.qft_d00"`` when the number of qubits is 
    :math:`\leq 4`, ``"ModularAdder.modular_v17"`` in all other cases.

upgrade_circuits:
  - |
    The circuit definition of :class:`.ModularAdderGate` has been upgraded to use
    :func:`.adder_modular_v17`. To obtain the old behaviour, use the definition of
    :func:`.adder_qft_d00` instead.
