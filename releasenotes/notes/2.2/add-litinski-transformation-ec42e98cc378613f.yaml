    Added a new transpiler pass :class:`.LitinskiTransformation`
    that implements the transform described in `arXiv:1808.02892 <https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.02892>`__.

    The input to the pass is a circuit with Clifford and single-qubit RZ-rotation gates, and the output
    is a circuit with multi-qubit Pauli rotations (implemented as :class:`.PauliEvolutionGate` gates)
    followed by Clifford gates. The pass raises a :class:`~qiskit.transpiler.exceptions.TranspilerError`
    exception if the circuit contains non-supported gates.

    The pass supports all of the Clifford gates in the list returned by :func:`.get_clifford_gate_names`,
    namely
    ``["id", "x", "y", "z", "h", "s", "sdg", "sx", "sxdg", "cx", "cz", "cy", "swap", "iswap", "ecr", "dcx"]``.
    The list of supported RZ-rotations is ``["t", "tdg", "rz"]`` (we automatically convert T and Tdg gates
    to RZ-rotations).

    In addition, the :class:`.LitinskiTransformation` constructor accepts an argument ``fix_clifford``.
    When ``False`` (non-default), the returned circuit contains only :class:`.PauliEvolutionGate` gates,
    with the final Clifford gates omitted. Note that in this case the operators of the original and
    synthesized circuits will generally not be equivalent.

    For example::

      from qiskit.circuit import QuantumCircuit
      from qiskit.transpiler.passes import LitinskiTransformation
      from qiskit.quantum_info import Operator

      # The following quantum circuit consists of 5 Clifford gates
      # and two single-qubits RZ-rotation gates (note that Tdg is
      # an RZ-rotation).
      qc = QuantumCircuit(2)
      qc.cx(0, 1)
      qc.rz(0.1, 0)
      qc.cz(0, 1)
      qc.tdg(1)
      qc.h(1)
      qc.s(1)
      qc.cz(1, 0)

      # The transformed circuit consists of two PauliEvolution gates
      # and the same Clifford gates as in the original circuit.
      qct = LitinskiTransformation()(qc)

      # The circuits before and after the transformation are equivalent
      assert Operator(qc) == Operator(qct)
