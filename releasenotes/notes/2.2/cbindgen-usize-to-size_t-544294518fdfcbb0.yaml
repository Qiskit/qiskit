    Most usage of ``uintptr_t`` has been changed to ``size_t``. Specifically the following usages have been changed:

      * :c:member:`QkOpCount.count`
      * :c:member:`QkOpCounts.len`
      * :c:member:`QkObsTerm.len`
      * The return type of :c:func:`qk_circuit_num_instructions`.
      * The ``index`` argument in :c:func:`qk_circuit_get_instruction`.
      * The ``boundaries`` argument in :c:func:`qk_obs_new`.
      * The return types of :c:func:`qk_obs_num_terms`, :c:func:`qk_obs_len`, and :c:func:`qk_obs_boundaries`.
      * The return type of :c:func:`qk_target_entry_num_properties`, and :c:func:`qk_target_num_instructions`.

    This change was necessary because the tool used to generate the C header files from Qiskit's rust code,
    `cbindgen <https://github.com/mozilla/cbindgen?tab=readme-ov-file>`__ was using ``uintptr_t`` by default in places
    where ``size_t`` more accurately aligned with the type usage in Rust. This change was made to make it more clear
    how the values in the C API are intended to be used.
