    A new method, :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.ensure_physical`, is provided to ensure that a circuit is
    defined over physical qubits, with the qubit indices referring to physical qubits.  See the
    :ref:`new discussion on abstract- and physical-circuit representations in the documentation
    <circuit-abstract-physical>` for more detail on the metadata concepts.  The concepts of
    "abstract" and "physical" circuits are not at all new to Qiskit, just the explicit
    documentation.
features_transpiler:

    A new method, :meth:`.DAGCircuit.make_physical`, is provided, which efficiently replaces the
    qubits in the :class:`.DAGCircuit` with the canonical physical-qubit register, potentially
    including expansion.  A similar method, :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.ensure_physical` is also
    available.
