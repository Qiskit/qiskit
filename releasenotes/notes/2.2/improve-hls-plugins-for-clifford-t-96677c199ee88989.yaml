    Added a new class :class:`.OptimizationMetric` which specifies the optimization
    criterion in the :class:`.HighLevelSynthesis` pass. Currently the two supported
    metrics are:

    * ``COUNT_2Q``: optimizes the number of two-qubit gates.
    * ``COUNT_T``: optimizes the number of T-gates, when transpiling into a Clifford+T
      basis set.

    The transpiler automatically selects the target metric based on the basis gate set,
    e.g. it will use ``COUNT_T`` if a Clifford+T basis set is detected. This argument
    cannot yet be set manually at the level of :func:`~qiskit.compiler.transpile`.

    Added a new argument ``optimization_metric`` of type :class:`.OptimizationMetric`
    to the :class:`.HighLevelSynthesis` transpiler pass. When set to ``COUNT_T``,
    the pass chooses decompositions that are more suitable for the Clifford+T gate
    set.

    The default high-level synthesis plugins for :class:`.ModularAdderGate` and
    :class:`.MultiplierGate` produce better T-counts when transpiling into Clifford+T
    basis set.

    The default high-level synthesis plugin for :class:`.MCXGate` produces
    better T-counts when transpiling into Clifford+T basis set, provided at least
    1 ancilla qubit is available.
