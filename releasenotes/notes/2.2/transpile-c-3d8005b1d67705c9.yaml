    Added a new function ``transpile()`` to the Qiskit C API. This function is used for transpiling
    quantum circuits in a standalone C context without using Python. This is the last major component
    needed in the C API for typical hardware execution workflows using Qiskit.

    This function mirrors the preset pass managers that are used for the Python transpiler except for
    some passes and functionality is skipped if it is not relevant for circuits constructed using the C
    API. This makes the function only suitable for standalone C contexts.
