    Fixed a problem in high-level synthesis plugins :class:`.MCXSynthesis1DirtyKG24`
    and :class:`.MCXSynthesis2DirtyKG24` for :class:`.MCXGate`, where the plugins
    did not consider available clean auxiliary qubits as available dirty auxiliary
    qubits. In particular, the plugin :class:`.MCXSynthesis2DirtyKG24` did not apply
    when one clean and one dirty auxiliary qubits were available.
