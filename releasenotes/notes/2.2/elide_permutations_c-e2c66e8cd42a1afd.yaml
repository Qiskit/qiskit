    Added a new standalone transpiler pass function
    :cpp:func:`qk_transpiler_pass_standalone_elide_permutations`, which is for running the
    :class:`.ElidePermutations` transpiler pass. Calling this function in C is equivalent
    to running the pass in Python like::

      ElidePermutations(..)(circuit)
