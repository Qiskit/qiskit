    A new fast-path method :meth:`.ParameterExpression.bind_all` is added to support the use-case of
    binding many different :class:`.ParameterExpression` instances to numeric values using the same
    mappings dictionary.  The existing :meth:`~.ParameterExpression.bind` method has a large amount
    of overhead and unnecessary allocations, since it always returns a :class:`.ParameterExpression`
    for typing consistency.
