fixes:
  - |
    Previously, when creating a multiply controlled phase gate via
    ``PhaseGate.control``, an ``MCU1Gate`` gate had been returned. This has been
    had corrected so that an ``MCPhaseGate`` is returned.
  - |
    Previously, attempting to decompose a circuit containing an
    ``MCPhaseGate`` would raise an error due to an inconsistency in the
    definition of the ``MCPhaseGate``. This has been corrected.
