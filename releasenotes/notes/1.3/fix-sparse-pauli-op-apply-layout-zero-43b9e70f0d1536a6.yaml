    Fixed :meth:`.SparsePauliOp.apply_layout` to work correctly with zero-qubit operators.
    For example, previously if you created a zero-qubit operator and applied a layout like the following, it would have raised an error::
    
        op = SparsePauliOp("")
        op.apply_layout(None, 3)

    Now, the above code correctly returns an operator of the following form::
    ``SparsePauliOp(['III'], coeffs=[1.+0.j])``
