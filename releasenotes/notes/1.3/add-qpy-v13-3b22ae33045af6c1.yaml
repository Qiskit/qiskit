    Added a new QPY format version 13 that adds a Qiskit native representation
    of :class:`.ParameterExpression` objects.
issues:
  - |
    When using QPY formats 10, 11, or 12 with circuits that contain
    :class:`.ParameterExpression`\s, if the version of the ``symengine`` package
    installed in the environment that generated the payload (:func:`.qpy.dump`) does
    not match the version of ``symengine`` installed in the enviroment where the
    payload is loaded (:func:`.qpy.load`), you will get an error. If you encounter
    this error, install the ``symengine`` version from the error message
    before calling :func:`.qpy.load`. QPY format versions 13 or later
    (or prior to 10) will not have this issue. Therefore, if you're serializing
    :class:`.ParameterExpression` objects as part of your circuit or any
    :class:`.ScheduleBlock` objects, it is recommended that you use version 13 to avoid
    this issue in the future.
upgrade_qpy:
  - |
    The :func:`.qpy.dump` function now emits format version 13 by default.
    This means payloads generated with this function by default are only
    compatible with Qiskit 1.3.0 or later. If the payload needs to be
    loaded by an earlier version of Qiskit, use the ``version`` flag on
    :func:`.qpy.dump` to emit the appropriate version. Refer to
    :ref:`qpy_compatibility` for more details.
