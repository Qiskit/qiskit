    Added a new QPY format version 13 that adds a Qiskit native representation
    of :class:`.ParameterExpression` objects.
issues:
  - |
    When using QPY formats 10, 11, or 12 there is a dependency on the version
    of ``symengine`` installed in the payload for serialized
    :class:`.ParamerExpression` if there is mismatched version of the installed
    ``symengine`` package between the environment that generated the payload with
    :func:`.qpy.dump` and the installed version that is trying to load the payload
    with :func:`.qpy.load`. If this is encountered you will need to install the
    symengine version from the error message emitted to load the payload. QPY
    format version >= 13 (or < 10) will not have this issue and it is recommended
    if you're serializing :class:`.ParameterExpression` objects as part of your
    circuit or any :class:`.ScheduleBlock` objects you use version 13 to avoid
    this issue in the future.
upgrade_qpy:

    The :func:`.qpy.dump` function will now emit format version 13 by default.
    This means payloads generated with this function by default will only
    be compatible with Qiskit >= 1.3.0. If you need for the payload to be
    loaded by a older version of Qiskit you can use the ``version`` flag on
    :func:`.qpy.dump` to emit a version compatible with earlier releases of
    Qiskit. You can refer to :ref:`qpy_compatibility` for more details on this.
