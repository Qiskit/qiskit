    Added a new transpiler pass, :class:`.RemoveIdentityEquivalent` that is used
    to remove gates that are equivalent to an identity up to some tolerance.
    For example if you had a circuit like:

        .. plot::

           from qiskit.circuit import QuantumCircuit

           qc = QuantumCircuit(2)
           qc.cp(1e-20, 0, 1)
           qc.draw("mpl")

    running the pass would eliminate the :class:`.CPhaseGate`:

        .. plot::
           :include-source:

           from qiskit.circuit import QuantumCircuit
           from qiskit.transpiler.passes import RemoveIdentityEquivalent

           qc = QuantumCircuit(2)
           qc.cp(1e-20, 0, 1)

           removal_pass = RemoveIdentityEquivalent()
           result = removal_pass(qc)
           result.draw("mpl")
