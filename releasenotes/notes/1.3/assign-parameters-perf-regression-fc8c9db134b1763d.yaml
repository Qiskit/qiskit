    Fixed a performance regression in :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.assign_parameters` introduced in Qiskit
    1.2.0 when calling the method in a tight loop, that caused only a small number of 
    parameters from a heavily parametric circuit to be bound on each iteration. If possible, it is still
    more performant to call :meth:`~.QuantumCircuit.assign_parameters` only once, with all
    assignments at the same time, as this reduces the proportion of time spent on input normalization
    and error-checking overhead.
