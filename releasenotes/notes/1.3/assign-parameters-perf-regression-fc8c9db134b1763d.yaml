    Fixed a performance regression in :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.assign_parameters` introduced in Qiskit
    1.2.0 when calling the method in a tight loop, binding only a small number of parameters out of
    a heavily parametric circuit on each iteration.  If possible, it is still more performant to
    call :meth:`~.QuantumCircuit.assign_parameters` only once, with all assignments at the same
    time, as this reduces the proportion of time spent on input normalization and error-checking
    overhead.
