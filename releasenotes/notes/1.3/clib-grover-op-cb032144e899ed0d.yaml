    Added :func:`.grover_operator` to construct a Grover operator circuit, used in e.g.
    Grover's algorithm and amplitude estimation/amplification. This function is similar to
    :class:`.GroverOperator`, but does not require choosing the implementation of the
    multi-controlled X gate a-priori and let's the compiler choose the optimal decomposition
    instead. In addition to this, it does not wrap the circuit into an opaque gate and is 
    faster as less decompositions are required to transpile.

    Example::

        from qiskit.circuit import QuantumCircuit
        from qiskit.circuit.library import grover_operator

        oracle = QuantumCircuit(2)
        oracle.z(0)  # good state = first qubit is |1>
        grover_op = grover_operator(oracle, insert_barriers=True)
        print(grover_op.draw())
