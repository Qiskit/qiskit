    Added :func:`~qiskit.circuit.library.grover_operator` to construct a Grover operator circuit, used in
    Grover's algorithm and amplitude estimation/amplification, for example. This function is similar to
    :class:`.GroverOperator`, but does not require you to choose the implementation of the
    multi-controlled X gate, but instead lets the compiler determine the optimal decomposition.
    Additionally, it does not wrap the circuit into an opaque gate and is
    faster because fewer decompositions are required for transpilation.

      :include-source:

        from qiskit.circuit import QuantumCircuit
        from qiskit.circuit.library import grover_operator

        oracle = QuantumCircuit(2)
        oracle.z(0)  # good state = first qubit is |1>
        grover_op = grover_operator(oracle, insert_barriers=True)
        grover_op.draw('mpl')
