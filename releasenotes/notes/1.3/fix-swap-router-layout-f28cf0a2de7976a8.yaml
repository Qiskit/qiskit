    Fixed an oversight in the :class:`.Commuting2qGateRouter` transpiler pass where the qreg permutations
    were not added to the pass property set, so they would have to be tracked manually by the user. Now it's 
    possible to access the permutation through the output circuit's ``layout`` property and plug the pass
    into any transpilation pipeline without loss of information.
