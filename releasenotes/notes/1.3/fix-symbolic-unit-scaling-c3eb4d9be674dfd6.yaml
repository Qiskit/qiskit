    Fixed a floating-point imprecision when scaling certain pulse units
    between seconds and nanoseconds.  If the pulse was symbolically defined,
    an unnecessary floating-point error could be introduced by the scaling
    for certain builds of ``symengine``, which could manifest in unexpected
    results once the symbols were fully bound.  See `#12392 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/pull/12392>`__.
