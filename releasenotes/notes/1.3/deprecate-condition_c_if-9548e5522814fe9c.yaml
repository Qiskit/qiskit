deprecations_circuits:

    Deprecated the :attr:`.Instruction.condition` attribute and the
    :meth:`.Instruction.c_if` method. They will be removed
    in Qiskit 2.0, along with any uses in the Qiskit data
    model. This functionality has been superseded by the :class:`.IfElseOp` class
    which can be used to describe a classical condition in a circuit. For
    example, a circuit using  :meth:`.Instruction.c_if` like::

        from qiskit.circuit import QuantumCircuit

        qc = QuantumCircuit(2, 2)
        qc.h(0)
        qc.x(0).c_if(0, 1)
        qc.z(1.c_if(1, 0)
        qc.measure(0, 0)
        qc.measure(1, 1)

    can be rewritten as::

        qc = QuantumCircuit(2, 2)
        qc.h(0)
        with expected.if_test((expected.clbits[0], True)):
            qc.x(0)
        with expected.if_test((expected.clbits[1], False)):
            qc.z(1)
        qc.measure(0, 0)
        qc.measure(1, 1)

    The now deprecated :class:`.ConvertConditionsToIfOps` transpiler pass can
    be used to automate this conversion for existing circuits.
deprecations_transpiler:
  - |
    The transpiler pass :class:`.ConvertConditionsToIfOps` has been deprecated
    and will be removed in Qiskit 2.0.0. This class is now deprecated because
    the underlying data model for :attr:`.Instruction.condition` which this
    pass is converting from has been deprecated and will be removed in 2.0.0.
