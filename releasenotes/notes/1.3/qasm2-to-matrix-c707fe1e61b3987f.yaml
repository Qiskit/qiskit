    Custom gates (those stemming from a ``gate`` statement) in imported OpenQASM 2 programs will now
    have an :meth:`.Gate.to_matrix` implementation.  Previously they would have no matrix definition,
    meaning that roundtrips through OpenQASM 2 could needlessly lose the ability to derive the gate
    matrix.  Note, though, that the matrix is calculated by recursively finding the matrices of the
    inner gate definitions, as :class:`.Operator` does, which might be less performant than before
    the round-trip.
