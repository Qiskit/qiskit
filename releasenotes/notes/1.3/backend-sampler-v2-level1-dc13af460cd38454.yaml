features:
  - |
    Support for level 1 data was added to :class:`~.BackendSamplerV2`, as was
    support for passing options through to the ``run()`` method of the wrapped
    :class:`~.BackendV2`. The run options can be specified by using a
    ``"run_options"`` entry inside the ``options`` dictionary passed to
    :class:`~.BackendSamplerV2`. The ``"run_options"`` entry should be a
    dictionary that maps argument names to values to be passed to the backend's
    ``run()`` method. When a ``"meas_level = 1 "`` is set
    in the run options, the results from the backend will be treated as level 1
    results instead of bit arrays (the level 2 format).
upgrade:

    When using :class:`~.BackendSamplerV2`, circuit metadata is no longer
    cleared before passing circuits to the ``run()`` method of the wrapped
    :class:`~.BackendV2` instance.
