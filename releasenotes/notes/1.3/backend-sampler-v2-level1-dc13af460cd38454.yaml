features:
  - |
    Support for level 1 data was added to :class:`~.BackendSamplerV2` as was
    support for passing options through to the ``run()`` method of the wrapped
    :class:`~.BackendV2`. The run options can be specified using a
    ``"run_options"`` entry inside of the ``options`` dicitonary passed to
    :class:`~.BackendSamplerV2`. The ``"run_options"`` entry should be a
    dictionary mapping argument names to values for passing to the backend's
    ``run()`` method. When a ``"meas_level"`` option with a value of 1 is set
    in the run options, the results from the backend will be treated as level 1
    results rather as bit arrays (the level 2 format).

    When using :class:`~.BackendSamplerV2`, circuit metadata is no longer
    cleared before passing circuits to the ``run()`` method of the wrapped
    :class:`~.BackendV2` instance.
