    The :class:`.RemoveIdentityEquivalent` transpiler pass is now run as part
    of the preset pass managers at optimization levels 2 and 3. The pass is
    run in the ``init`` stage and the ``optimization`` stage, because the
    optimizations it applies are valid in both stages and the pass is
    fast to execute.
