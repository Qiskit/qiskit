    The :class:`.RemoveIdentityEquivalent` transpiler pass is now run as part
    of the preset pass managers at optimization levels 2 and 3. The pass runs
    during the ``init`` and ``optimization`` stages, because the
    optimizations it applies are valid in both stages and the pass is
    fast to execute.
