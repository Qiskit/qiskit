    Added a new method :meth:`.DAGCircuit.control_flow_op_nodes` which provides a fast
    path to get all the :class:`.DAGOpNode` in a :class:`.DAGCircuit` that
    contain a :class:`.ControlFlowOp`. This was possible before using the
    :meth:`.DAGCircuit.op_nodes` method and passing the :class:`.ControlFlowOp` class
    as a filter, but this new function will perform the operation faster.
