    The class :class:`.qasm3.CustomGate` is now inspectable programmatically.  Its
    :attr:`~.qasm3.CustomGate.constructor`, :attr:`~.qasm3.CustomGate.name`,
    :attr:`~.qasm3.CustomGate.num_params` and :attr:`~.qasm3.CustomGate.num_qubits` can now be
    viewed from Python after the object has been constructed.  This allows you to inspect the
    contents of provided data attributes like :data:`.STDGATES_INC_GATES`.
