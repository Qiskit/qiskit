    The :class:`.StabilizerState` class now has a new method 
    :meth:`~.StabilizerState.probabilities_dict_from_bitstring` allowing the 
    user to pass a single bitstring to measure an outcome for. Previously, the 
    :meth:`~.StabilizerState.probabilities_dict` would be utilized and would, 
    in the worst case, calculate (2^n) probability calculations (depending
    on the state), even if a user wanted a single result. With this new method 
    the user can calculate just the single outcome bitstring value a user passes 
    to measure the probability for. As the number of qubits increases, the more 
    prevalent the performance enhancement may be (depending on the state) as only 
    one bitstring result is measured.
