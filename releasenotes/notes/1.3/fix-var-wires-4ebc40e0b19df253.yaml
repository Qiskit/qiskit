    Fixed an issue with :func:`.dag_drawer` and :meth:`.DAGCircuit.draw`
    when attempting to visualize a :class:`.DAGCircuit` instance that contained
    :class:`.Var` wires, for which the visualizer would raise an exception.
    This behavior has been fixed and the expected visualization will be
    generated.
