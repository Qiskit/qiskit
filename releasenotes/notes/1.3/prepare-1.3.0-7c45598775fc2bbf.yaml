    Qiskit version 1.3.0 brings in major performance and quality improvements
    for the transpiler. The minimum required Python version is now 3.9.

    There have been many new features, fixes and improvements introduced in this
    new version of Qiskit, some of which include:

      * The majority of the transpiler passes used by the preset pass 
        manager have been ported into Rust, resulting in a 6x overall runtime 
        improvement compared to Qiskit 1.2.4. The ported passes include :class:`.BasisTranslator`,
        :class:`.CommutationAnalysis`, :class:`.ConsolidateBlocks`, :class:`.UnitarySynthesis`,
        and others.

      * Improvements to the circuit library that increase compilation quality and
        construction speed. These changes include developments such as improved qubit
        tracking for :class:`.HighLevelSynthesis`, structural circuits as part of the library
        such as IQP, and the addition of :class:`.PauliEvolutionGate` and its operability with 
        `Rustiq <https://github.com/smartiel/rustiq>`_.

      * The deprecation of the Qiskit pulse module and all of its related components. 
        The pulse module and its functionality will be part of `Qiskit Dynamics <https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-dynamics>`_.
