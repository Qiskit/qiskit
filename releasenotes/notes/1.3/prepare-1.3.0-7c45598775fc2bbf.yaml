    Qiskit version 1.3.0 brings in major performance and quality improvements
    for the transpiler.

    There have been many new features, fixes and improvements introduced in this
    new version of Qiskit, the highlights are:

      * The core data structures for transpilation in Qiskit have been ported
         to Rust internally. This includes components such as the
         :class:`.DAGCircuit`, :class:`.Target`, :class:`.EquivalenceLibrary`,
        and others. The public APIs for all of these data structures remains
        unchanged but the performance after the rewrites has improved.

      * The majority of the transpiler passes used by the preset pass 
        manager have been ported into Rust, resulting in an average 6x overall runtime 
        improvement compared to Qiskit 1.2.4 when running the
        `benchpress benchmarks <https://github.com/Qiskit/benchpress/>`__.
        Some of the particularly impactful passes that greatly benefited from
        the rewrites were the :class:`.BasisTranslator`,
        :class:`.CommutationAnalysis`, :class:`.ConsolidateBlocks`, and :class:`.UnitarySynthesis`.
        You can refer to the feature release notes for a full list of the ported passes.

      * Improvements to the circuit library that increase compilation quality and circuit
        construction speed. Operations are now distinguished into:

        * Structural operations, that have a unique decomposition, and are represented as
          functions that return a :class:`.QuantumCircuit` (for example: :func:`.real_amplitudes`).
          Most of these functions are built in Rust, resulting in significantly faster circuit
          construction runtime.
        * Abstract operations, that can be implemented using different decompositions, are
          represented as :class:`.Gate` or :class:`qiskit.circuit.Instruction` (for example:
          :class:`.PauliEvolutionGate`). This allows building an abstract quantum circuit
          and letting the compiler choose the optimal decomposition.

        Using an abstract circuit description is especially powerful in combination with 
        improvements to the :class:`.HighLevelSynthesis` transpiler pass, which can now take
        into account idle auxiliary qubits to find the best available decomposition for a given gate.

      * The minimum supported Python version is now 3.9 as Python 3.8 went end of life in 2024-10. Official support for Python 3.13 support was also added in this release.
