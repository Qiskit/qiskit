    Qiskit version 1.3.0 brings in major performance and quality improvements
    for the transpiler.

    There have been many new features, fixes and improvements introduced in this
    new version of Qiskit, the highlights are:

      * Essential features of Qiskit have either been ported into Rust
        or have a representation with Rust-native datatypes. Some of these
        components include the :class:`.DAGCircuit`, the :class:`.Target`,
        the :class:`.EquivalenceLibrary`.

      * The majority of the transpiler passes used by the preset pass 
        manager have been ported into Rust, resulting in a 6x overall runtime 
        improvement compared to Qiskit 1.2.4. The ported passes include :class:`.BasisTranslator`,
        :class:`.CommutationAnalysis`, :class:`.ConsolidateBlocks`, :class:`.UnitarySynthesis`,
        and others.

      * Improvements to the circuit library that increase compilation quality and
        construction speed. These changes include developments such as improved qubit
        tracking for :class:`.HighLevelSynthesis`, structural circuits as part of the library
        such as :func:`.iqp`. Additionally the :class:`.PauliEvolutionGate` has been updated
        to leverage high level synthesis plugins including a new plugin that leverages the
        circuit synthesis library `Rustiq <https://github.com/smartiel/rustiq>`_.
      
      * The minimum required Python version is now 3.9.
