    The transpilation pass :class:`.InverseCancellation` now will recurse into :class:`.ControlFlowOp`
    operations present in a :class:`.QuantumCircuit`. Previously, the pass would ignore
    inverse gate pairs inside control flow blocks that could have been cancelled. Refer to
    `#13437 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/13437>`__ for more details.
