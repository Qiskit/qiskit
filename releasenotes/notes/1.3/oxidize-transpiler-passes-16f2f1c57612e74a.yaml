    Most of the transpiler passes required by the preset pass manager have
    been ported into Rust, these include:

    * :class:`.ConsolidateBlocks`: the pass now runs up to 3x faster than it did with Python.
    
    * :class:`.BasisTranslator`: it now runs 3x to 5x faster than it did in Python.

    * :class:`.CommutationAnalysis`: exists in rust as :func:`.analyze_commutations`.
      Testing on ASV benchmarks reveals increased performance of up to 3x compared to Python.

    * :class:`~.ElidePermutations`: On certain tests the demostrated speedup is between 5x and 10x from
      its previous Python implementation.

    * :class:`.Optimize1qGatesDecomposition`: the runtime performance of the pass has
      improved between 5x to 10x.
    
    * :class:`.CommutationChecker`: Depending on the circuit type we can observe a speedup of
      up to 5x in comparison to Python.
    
    * The circuit library functions rust-native functions :func:`.pauli_feature_map`,
      :func:`.z_feature_map`, and :func:`.zz_feature_map` will replace the current
      circuit library objects: :class:`.PauliFeatureMap`, :class:`.ZFeatureMap`, and
      :class:`.ZZFeatureMap`. From multiple benchmark runs, a speedup of up to 8x was
      observed, in comparison to Python.

    * :class:`.UnitarySynthesis`: the pass seems to run about 1.5x faster than it did in Python.

    * :class:`.GateDirection`: runs between 9x and 16x faster than it did in Python.

    * :class:`.CheckGateDirection`: runs an average of 12x faster than it did in Python.

    * :class:`.RemoveDiagonalGatesBeforeMeasure`: runs an average of 23x faster than it did
      in Python.

    * :class:`.CheckMap`: Runs up to 50x faster than in Python.

    * :class:`.Split2QUnitaties`: Runs about 1.5x faster than in Python.

    * :class:`.StarPrerouting`: Runs about 1.2x faster than in Python.
    
    Other ported passes include: :class:`.FilterOpNodes`, :class:`.Depth`, :class:`.Size`,
    :class:`.GatesInBasis`, and :class:`.InverseCancellation`.
