features_transpiler:
  - |
    The majority of the transpiler passes used in the preset pass managers
    returned by :func:`.generate_preset_pass_manager` and used internally
    by :func:`.transpile` were ported into Rust. This has significantly
    improved the runtime performance of each pass which has led to a
    significant improvement in the overall operational efficiency of the
    transpiler. The list of passes ported to Rust in this release are:

    * :class:`.ConsolidateBlocks`
    * :class:`.BasisTranslator`
    * :class:`.CommutationAnalysis`
    * :class:`.CommutativeCancellation`
    * :class:`.ElidePermutations`
    * :class:`.Optimize1qGatesDecomposition`
    * :class:`.UnitarySynthesis`
    * :class:`.GateDirection`
    * :class:`.CheckGateDirection`
    * :class:`.RemoveDiagonalGatesBeforeMeasure`
    * :class:`.CheckMap`
    * :class:`.Split2QUnitaries`
    * :class:`.FilterOpNodes`
    * :class:`.Depth`
    * :class:`.Size`
    * :class:`.GatesInBasis`
    * :class:`.InverseCancellation`
    * :class:`.BarrierBeforeFinalMeasurements`

features_circuits:
  - |
    The :class:`.CommutationChecker` class has been rewritten in Rust.
    This class retains the same functionality and public API as before
    but is now significantly faster in most cases.
