    Fixed an issue with `pulse_v2` visualization that doesn't differ
    the backend version passed through it. Before these changes,
    some backend attributes could be expected from a wrong place, raising
    `AttributeError`.
    Now, the function checks what's the backend version, and get
    the relative adapter that takes charge to get the correct values.
    Fixed `#10993 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/10993>`__
