deprecations:
  - |
    The :class:`.NoiseAdaptiveLayout` transpiler pass and the corresponding
    ``"noise_adaptive"`` layout stage plugin have been deprecated and will
    be removed in the 1.0.0 release. This pass has been largely superseded by
    :class:`.VF2Layout` and :class:`.VF2PostLayout` which will set a layout
    based on the reported noise characteristics of a backend.
  - |
    The :class:`.CrosstalkAdaptiveSchedule` transpiler pass has been deprecated
    and will be removed in the 1.0.0 release. This pass was not usable any
    longer because its internal operation was dependent on custom properties
    being set in the :class:`.BackendProperties` payload of a
    :class:`.BackendV1` instance. As no backends are setting these fields
    the pass has been deprecated.
