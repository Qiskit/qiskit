fixes:
  - |
    Fixed an issue in the ``text`` circuit drawer when displaying operations
    that were not :class:`.circuit.instruction.Instruction` class. These operations
    would cause the drawer to fail. Examples were :class:`.Clifford` and
    :class:`.AnnotatedOperation`.
features:
  - |
    The ``text`` and ``mpl`` circuit drawers will now display detailed
    information for operations of :class:`.AnnotatedOperation`. If the
    :attr:`.AnnotatedOperation.modifiers` contains a :class:`.ControlModifier`
    the operation will be displayed the same way as controlled gates. If
    the :class:'.InverseModifier` or :class:`.PowerModifier` is used,
    these will be indicated with the base operation name.
