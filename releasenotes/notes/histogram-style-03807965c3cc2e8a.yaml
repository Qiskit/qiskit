    Removes the hard-coding of style options for :func:`~.plot_histogram`.  This allows
    Matplotlib style files to be faithfully applied to the figures.  Users looking to go
    beyond the defaults set by Matplotlib can make their own style files, or pass a
    Matplotlib ``Axes`` object to ``plot_histogram`` and post-apply any customizations.
