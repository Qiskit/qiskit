    The :class:`.SabreSwap` transpiler pass, and by extension
    :class:`.SabreLayout` and :func:`.transpile` at ``optimization_level=3``,
    now has an escape mechanism to guarantee that it can never get stuck in an
    infinite loop.  Certain inputs previously could, with a great amount of bad
    luck, get stuck in a stable local minimum of the search space and the pass
    would never make further progress.  It will now force a series of swaps that
    allow the routing to continue if it detects it has not made progress
    recently.  Fixed `#7707 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/7707>`__.
