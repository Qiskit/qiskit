    The decorators :func:`deprecate_func` and :func:`deprecate_arg` changed their default behaivor to adapt to the
    Qiskit SemVer versioning (`RFC0020` <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/8729>`__). As a consequence,
    the parameter ``removal_timeline`` default changed: from "no earlier than 3 months after the release date" to "in the next major
    release {``since`` major + 1}". If you would like to preserve the previous messaging, you should set ``removal_timeline`` explicitly.
