    A new color scheme, ``iqx``, has been added to the ``mpl`` circuit drawer. This uses
    the same color scheme as the Circuit Composer on the IBM Quantum Experience website.
    There are now 3 available color schemes - ``default``, ``iqx``, and ``bw``.

    There are 2 ways to select a color scheme. In the ``~/.qiskit`` directory, in the
    file ``settings.conf`` under the [Default] heading, a user can enter
    ``circuit_mpl_style = iqx`` to select the ``iqx`` color scheme.

    The second way is to add ``{'name': 'iqx'}`` to the ``style`` parameter to the
    ``QuantumCircuit.draw`` method or to the ``circuit_drawer`` function. The second
    way will override the setting in the settings.conf file. For example,
    circuit.draw('mpl', style={'name': 'iqx'})

    In the ``style`` dict, the ``displaycolor`` dict now allows for entering both the gate
    color and the text color for each gate type in the form (gate_color, text_color).
    This allows the use of light and dark gate colors with contrasting text colors.
    Users can still set only the gate color, in which case the ``gatetextcolor`` will
    be used. Gate colors can be set in the ``style`` dict for any number of gate types,
    from one to the entire ``displaycolor`` dict. For example,
    'u1': ('#FA74A6', '#000000') or 'u1': '#FA74A6'
