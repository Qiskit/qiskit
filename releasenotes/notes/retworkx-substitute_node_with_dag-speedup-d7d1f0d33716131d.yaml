    Various transpilation internals now use new features in `retworkx
    <https://github.com/Qiskit/retworkx>`__ 0.10 when operating on the internal
    circuit representation.  This can often result in speedups in calls to
    :obj:`~qiskit.transpile` of around 10-40%, with greater effects at higher
    optimisation levels.  See `#6302
    <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/pull/6302>`__ for more details.
