    Every attribute of the :class:`~qiskit.circuit.algorithms.VQE` class that is set at the initialization is now 
    accessible with getters and setters. Further, the default values of the VQE attributes such as `ansatz`,
    `optimizer` or `quantum_instance` can be reset by setting the attribute to `None`.
    
    .. code-block:: python
    
        vqe = VQE(my_ansatz, my_optimizer)
        vqe.ansatz = None   # reset to default: RealAmplitudes ansatz
        vqe.optimizer = None  # reset to default: SLSQP optimizer

fixes:
  - |
    Fixes the fact that setting the `ansatz` or `optimizer` attributes of a `VQE` instance to `None` resulted in a buggy behavior, as explained in `#7093 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/7093>`.

upgrade:
  - |
    The `sort_parameters_by_name` of the :class:`~qiskit.circuit.algorithms.VQE` class has been removed, following its deprecation on July, 12th.
