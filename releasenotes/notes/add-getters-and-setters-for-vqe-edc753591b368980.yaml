features:
  - |
    The `max_evals_grouped`, `include_custom`, `callback` and `sort_parameters_by_name` attributes are now accessible without having to having their private counterpart.
  - |
    Setting the `ansatz` or the `optimizer` attributes to `None` now results in the same default behavior as instantiating the `VQE` class while setting these parameters to `None`.
  - |
    The `quantum_instance` attribute is now always defined even if the associated parameter during the `VQE` instantiation is set to `None`.
fixes:
  - |
    Fixes the fact that setting the `ansatz` or `optimizer` attributes to `None` resulted in a buggy behavior, as explained in `#7093 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/7093>`.
