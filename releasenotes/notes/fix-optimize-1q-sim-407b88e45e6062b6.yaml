    Fixed an issue with the :class:`.Optimize1qGatesDecomposition` transpiler
    pass where it would potentially resynthesize a single ideal (meaning the
    error rate is ``0.0``) gate which was present in the :class:`.Target`. This
    is now fixed so the pass :class:`.Optimize1qGatesDecomposition` will defer
    to the circuit's gate if the error rate (which includes number of gates)
    are the same.
    Fixed `#10568 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/10568>`__
