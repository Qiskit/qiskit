    Fixed an issue in the :class:`.Optimize1qGatesDecomposition` when the
    pass was initialized with a :class:`.Target` that contains 1q gates with fixed angle
    parameters. Previously, the pass would potentially output gates outside
    the target as it wasn't checking that the gate in the target supported
    arbitrary parameter values.
    Fixed `#14743 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/14743>`__.
