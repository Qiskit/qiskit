    Fixed an issue in the :class:`.Optimize1qGatesDecomposition`
    pass when the pass is initialized with a :class:`.Target` containing 1-qubit gates
    with fixed angle parameters. Previously, the pass would potentially output gates
    not included in the target as it did not check whether the gates in the target
    supported arbitrary parameter values.
    Fixed `#14743 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/14743>`__.
