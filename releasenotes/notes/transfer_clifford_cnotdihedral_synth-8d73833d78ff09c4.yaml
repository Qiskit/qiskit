upgrade:
  - |
    Added to Qiskit documentation the function
    :func:`qiskit.synthesis.synth_clifford_full` for synthesizing Clifford circuits for
    all-to-all architecture, which contains the following sub-functions:
    :func:`qiskit.synthesis.synth_clifford_ag` which is based on Aaronson and Gottesman,
    :func:`qiskit.synthesis.synth_clifford_greedy` which is based on the greedy
    Clifford compiler of Bravyi et. al., and :func:`qiskit.synthesis.synth_clifford_bm`
    for optimal synthesis of 2-qubit and 3-qubit Clifford circuits which is based on
    Bravyi and Maslov.
    Added to Qiskit documentation the function
    :func:`qiskit.synthesis.synth_cnotdihedral_full` for synthesizing CNOTDihedral circuits for
    all-to-all architecture, which contains the following sub-functions:
    :func:`qiskit.synthesis.synth_cnotdihedral_general` which is based on Cross et. al.,
    and :func:`qiskit.synthesis.synth_cnotdihedral_two_qubits` for optimal synthesis of 2-qubit
    CNOTDihedral elements which is based on Garion and Cross.
deprecations:
  - |
    The functions :func:`qiskit.quantum_info.synthesis.decompose_clifford`
    and :func:`qiskit.quantum_info.synthesis.decompose_cnot_dihedral`
    will be deprecated in the future release and subsequently removed after that.
    They are replaced by the two functions
    :func:`qiskit.synthesis.synth_clifford_full` and
    :func:`qiskit.synthesis.synth_cnotdihedral_full` respectively.
