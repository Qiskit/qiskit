    Fixed an issue with :func:`.qpy.dump` which would cause the function to
    potentially ignore the value of ``use_symengine`` when serializing a
    :class:`.ScheduleBlock` object. This would result in an invalid QPY
    payload being generated as it would report it was using symengine for
    symbolic expressions but actually contain sympy serialized data.
