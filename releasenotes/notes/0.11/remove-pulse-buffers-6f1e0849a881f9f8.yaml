deprecations:
  - Buffers in Pulse are deprecated. If a nonzero buffer is supplied, a warning
    will be issued with a reminder to use a Delay instead. Other options would
    include adding samples to a pulse instruction which are :math:`(0.+0.j)` or
    setting the start time of the next pulse to `schedule.duration + buffer`.
