    PassManagers can now be sliced to create a new Passmanager containing a
    subset of passes using the square bracket operator. This allow running or
    drawing a portion of the Passmanager for easier testing and visualization.
    For example let's try to draw the first 3 passes of a PassManager pm, or
    run just the second pass on our circuit:

    .. code-block:: python

      pm[0:4].draw()
      circuit2 = pm[1].run(circuit)

    Also now, PassManagers can be created by adding two PassManagers or by
    directly adding a pass/list of passes to a PassManager.

    .. code-block:: python

      pm = pm1[0] + pm2[1:3]
      pm += [setLayout, unroller]
