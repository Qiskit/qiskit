    The ``latex`` output mode for ``qiskit.visualization.circuit_drawer()`` and
    the ``qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.draw()`` method now has a mode to
    passthrough raw latex from gate labels and parameters. The syntax
    for doing this mirrors matplotlib's
    `mathtext mode <https://matplotlib.org/tutorials/text/mathtext.html>`__
    syntax. Any portion of a label string between a pair of '$' characters will
    be treated as raw latex and passed directly into the generated output latex.
    This can be leveraged to add more advanced formatting to circuit diagrams
    generated with the latex drawer.

    Prior to this release all gate labels were run through a utf8 -> latex
    conversion to make sure that the output latex would compile the string as
    expected. This is still what happens for all portions of a label outside
    the '$' pair. Also if you want to use a dollar sign in your label make sure
    you escape it in the label string (ie ``'\$'``).

    You can mix and match this passthrough with the utf8 to latex conversion to
    create the exact label you want, for example::

        from qiskit import circuit
        circ = circuit.QuantumCircuit(2)
        circ.h([0, 1])
        circ.append(circuit.Gate(name='α_gate', num_qubits=1, params=[0]), [0])
        circ.append(circuit.Gate(name='α_gate$_2$', num_qubits=1, params=[0]), [1])
        circ.append(circuit.Gate(name='\$α\$_gate', num_qubits=1, params=[0]), [1])
        circ.draw(output='latex')

    will now render the first custom gate's label as ``α_gate``, the second
    will be ``α_gate`` with a 2 subscript, and the last custom gate's label
    will be ``$α$_gate``.
