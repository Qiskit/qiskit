deprecations:
  - |
    ``PulseChannelSpec`` is being deprecated. Use ``BackendConfiguration``
    instead. The backend configuration is accessed normally as
    ``backend.configuration()``. The config has been extended with most of
    the functionality of PulseChannelSpec, with some modifications as follows,
    where `0` is an exemplary qubit index::

        pulse_spec.drives[0]   -> config.drive(0)
        pulse_spec.measures[0] -> config.measure(0)
        pulse_spec.acquires[0] -> config.acquire(0)
        pulse_spec.controls[0] -> config.control(0)

    Now, if there is an attempt to get a channel for a qubit which does not
    exist for the device, a ``BackendConfigurationError`` will be raised with
    a helpful explanation.

    The methods ``memoryslots`` and ``registerslots`` of the PulseChannelSpec
    have not been migrated to the backend configuration. These classical
    resources are not restrained by the physical configuration of a backend
    system. Please instantiate them directly::

        pulse_spec.memoryslots[0] -> MemorySlot(0)
        pulse_spec.registerslots[0] -> RegisterSlot(0)

    The ``qubits`` method is not migrated to backend configuration. The result
    of ``qubits`` can be built as such::

        [q for q in range(backend.configuration().n_qubits)]
  - |
    ``Qubit`` within ``pulse.channels`` has been deprecated. They should not
    be used. It is possible to obtain channel <=> qubit mappings through the
    BackendConfiguration (or backend.configuration()).

upgrade:
  - |
    The ``qiskit.pulse.channels.SystemTopology`` class was used as a helper
    class for ``PulseChannelSpec``. It has been removed since with the deprecation
    of ``PulseChannelSpec`` and changes to ``BackendConfiguration`` make it
    unnecessary.
