    The function ``qiskit.visualization.circuit_drawer.qx_color_scheme()`` has
    been deprecated. This function is no longer used internally and doesn't
    reflect the current IBM QX style. If you were using this function to
    generate a style dict locally you must save the output from it and use
    that dictionary directly.
