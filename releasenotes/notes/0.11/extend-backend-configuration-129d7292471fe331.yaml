    PulseBackendConfiguration (accessed normally as backend.configuration())
    has been extended with useful methods to explore its data and the
    functionality that exists in PulseChannelSpec. PulseChannelSpec will be 
    deprecated in the future. For Example::

        backend = provider.get_backend(backend_name)
        config = backend.configuration()
        q0_drive = config.drive(0)  # or, DriveChannel(0)
        q0_meas = config.measure(0)  # MeasureChannel(0)
        q0_acquire = config.acquire(0)  # AcquireChannel(0)
        config.hamiltonian  # Returns a dictionary with hamiltonian info
        config.sample_rate()  # New method which returns 1 / dt
