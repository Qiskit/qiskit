deprecations:
  - |
    Passing in ``sympy.Basic``, ``sympy.Expr`` and ``sympy.Matrix`` types as
    instruction parameters are deprecated and will be removed in a future
    release. You'll need to convert the input to one of the supported types
    which are:

    * ``int``
    * ``float``
    * ``complex``
    * ``str``
    * ``np.ndarray``

other:
  - |
    All sympy parameter output type support have been been removed (or
    deprecated as noted) from qiskit-terra. This includes sympy type
    parameters in ``QuantumCircuit`` objects, qasm ast nodes, or ``Qobj``
    objects.
