upgrade:
  - |
    The previously deprecated representation of qubits and classical bits as
    tuple, which was deprecated in the 0.9 release, has been removed. The use
    of ``Qubit`` and ``Clbit`` objects is the new way to represent qubits and
    classical bits.
  - |
    The previously deprecated representation of the basis set as single string
    has been removed. A list of strings is the new preferred way.
  - |
    The method ``BaseModel.as_dict``, which was deprecated in the 0.9 release,
    has been removed in favor of the method ``BaseModel.to_dict``.
