    The 0.11.0 release includes several new features and bug fixes. The biggest
    change for this release is the addition of the pulse scheduler. This
    allows users to define their quantum program as a ``QuantumCircuit`` and
    then map it to the underlying pulse instructions that will control the
    quantum hardware to implement the circuit.
