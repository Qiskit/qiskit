    Added a new analysis pass ``Layout2qDistance``. This pass allows to "score"
    a layout selection, once ``property_set['layout']`` is set.  The score will
    be the sum of distances for each two-qubit gate in the circuit, when they
    are not directly connected. This scoring does not consider direction in the
    coupling map. The lower the number, the better the layout selection is.

    For example, consider a linear coupling map ``[0]--[2]--[1]`` and the
    following circuit::

        qr = QuantumRegister(2, 'qr')
        circuit = QuantumCircuit(qr)
        circuit.cx(qr[0], qr[1])
       
    If the layout is ``{qr[0]:0, qr[1]:1}``, ``Layout2qDistance`` will set
    ``property_set['layout_score'] = 1``. If the layout
    is ``{qr[0]:0, qr[1]:2}``, then the result
    is ``property_set['layout_score'] = 0``. The lower the score, the better.
