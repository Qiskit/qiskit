    ``PulseDefaults`` (accessed normally as ``backend.defaults()``) has an
    attribute, ``circuit_instruction_map`` which has the methods of CmdDef.
    The new `circuit_instruction_map` is an ``InstructionScheduleMap`` object
    with three new functions beyond what CmdDef had:

     * qubit_instructions(qubits) returns the operations defined for the qubits
     * assert_has(instruction, qubits) raises an error if the op isn't defined
     * remove(instruction, qubits) like pop, but doesn't require parameters

    There are some differences from the CmdDef:

     * ``__init__`` takes no arguments
     * ``cmds`` and ``cmd_qubits`` are deprecated and replaced with
       ``instructions`` and ``qubits_with_instruction``

    Example::

        backend = provider.get_backend(backend_name)
        inst_map = backend.defaults().circuit_instruction_map
        qubit = inst_map.qubits_with_instruction('u3')[0]
        x_gate = inst_map.get('u3', qubit, P0=np.pi, P1=0, P2=np.pi)
        pulse_schedule = x_gate(DriveChannel(qubit))

upgrade:
  - |
    In PulseDefaults (accessed normally as backend.defaults()),
    ``qubit_freq_est`` and ``meas_freq_est`` are now returned in Hz rather than
    GHz. This means the new return values are 1e9 * their previous value.
