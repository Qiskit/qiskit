    The new pulse drawer :func:`qiskit.visualization.pulse_drawer_v2` is now released.
    This drawer supports multiple new features:

    * Truncation of long pulse instructions.
    * Visualization of parametric pulses.
    * New stylesheets ``IQXStandard``, ``IQXSimple``, ``IQXDebugging``.
    * Visualization of system info (channel frequency, etc...) by specifying ``backend`` objects for visualization.
    * Specifying ``axis`` objects for plotting to allow further extension of generated plots, i.e., for publication manipulations.

    New stylesheets can take callback functions that dynamically modify the apperance of
    the output image, for example, reassembling a collection of channels,
    showing details of instructions, updating appearrance of pulse envelopes, etc...
    You can create custom callback functions and feed them into stylesheet instance to
    modify the figure appearance without modifying the drawer code.
    See pulse drawer module docstrings for details.

    Note that file saving is now delegated to the plotter software, i.e. Matplotlib.
    To save image files, you need to call `.savefig` method with returned Figure object.
