features:
  - |
    The number of qubits in ``BackendConfiguration`` can be accessed additionally via the
    property ``num_qubits`` (previously only ``n_qubits`` was supported).
deprecations:
  - |
    The ``n_qubits`` and ``numberofqubits`` keywords are deprecated throughout
    Terra and replaced by ``num_qubits``. The objects affected by this change are listed below.
