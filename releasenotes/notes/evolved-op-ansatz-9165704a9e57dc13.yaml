    Add the :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.EvolvedOperatorAnsatz` library circuit, which
    has previously been located in Qiskit Nature. This library circuit can be used to
    construct ansatz circuits that consist of time-evolved operators, where the evolution time
    is a variational parameter. Examples of such ansatz circuits include UCCSD in chemistry or
    QAOA in optimization.
