    Fixed the gate decomposition of multi-controlled Z rotation gates added via
    :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.mcrz`. Previously, this method implemented a multi-controlled
    phase gate, which has a relative phase difference  to the Z rotation. To obtain the
    previous `.QuantumCircuit.mcrz` behaviour, use `.QuantumCircuit.mcp`.
