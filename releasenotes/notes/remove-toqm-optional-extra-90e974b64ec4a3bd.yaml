upgrade:
  - |
    The ``toqm`` optional setuptools extra that previously enabled running
    ``pip install qiskit-terra[topm]`` has been removed as nothing in the
    Qiskit code base is currently using that package anymore. If you'd like
    to use the qiskit TOQM transpiler plugin you should install the
    ``qiskit-toqm`` package directly.
