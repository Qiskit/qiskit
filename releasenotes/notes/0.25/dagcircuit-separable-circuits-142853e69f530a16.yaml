    Introduced a new method, :meth:`~.DAGCircuit.separable_circuits`, which returns a
    list of :class:`.DAGCircuit` objects, one for each set of connected qubits
    which have no gates connecting them to another set.

    Each :class:`~.DAGCircuit` instance returned by this method will contain the same
    number of clbits as ``self``. This method will not return :class:`~.DAGCircuit`
    instances consisting solely of clbits.
