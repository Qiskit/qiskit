    Enabled performing the :class:`qiskit.transpiler.passes.CommutativeCancellation` pass inside the
    blocks of :class:`qiskit.circuit.ControlFlowOp`. This pass reorders some commuting gates and
    reduces resulting pairs of self-inverse gates. Previously, the blocks in control flow operations
    were skipped by this pass. The new feature operates recursively, that is, it will act on control
    flow operations inside blocks.
