    The method :meth:`~qiskit.pulse.schedule.ScheduleBlock.filter` is activated
    in the :class:`~qiskit.pulse.schedule.ScheduleBlock` class.
    This method enables users to retain only :class:`~qiskit.pulse.Instruction`
    objects which pass through all the provided filters.
    As builtin filter conditions, pulse :class:`~qiskit.pulse.channels.Channel`
    subclass instance and :class:`~qiskit.pulse.instructions.Instruction`
    subclass type can be specified.
    User-defined callbacks taking :class:`~qiskit.pulse.instructions.Instruction` instance
    can be added to the filters, too.

    The method :meth:`~qiskit.pulse.schedule.ScheduleBlock.exclude` is activated
    in the :class:`~qiskit.pulse.schedule.ScheduleBlock` class.
    This method enables users to retain only :class:`~qiskit.pulse.Instruction`
    objects which do not pass at least one of all the provided filters.
    As builtin filter conditions, pulse :class:`~qiskit.pulse.channels.Channel`
    subclass instance and :class:`~qiskit.pulse.instructions.Instruction`
    subclass type can be specified.
    User-defined callbacks taking :class:`~qiskit.pulse.instructions.Instruction` instance
    can be added to the filters, too.
    This method is the complement of :meth:`~qiskit.pulse.schedule.ScheduleBlock.filter`, so
    the following condition is always satisfied:
    ``block.filter(*filters) + block.exclude(*filters) == block`` in terms of
    instructions included, where ``block`` is a :class:`~qiskit.pulse.schedule.ScheduleBlock`
    instance.
