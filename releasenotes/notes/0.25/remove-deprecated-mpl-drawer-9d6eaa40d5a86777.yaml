    In the internal ``qiskit.visualization.circuit.matplotlib.MatplotlibDrawer`` object, the arguments
    ``layout``, ``global_phase``, ``qregs`` and ``cregs`` have been removed. They were originally
    deprecated in Qiskit Terra 0.20. These objects are simply inferred from the given ``circuit``
    now.
        
    This is an internal worker class of the visualization routines. It is unlikely you will
    need to change any of your code.
