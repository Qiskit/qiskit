    The :mod:`qiskit.algorithms` module has been deprecated and will be removed
    in a future release. It has been superseded by a new standalone library
    ``qiskit-algorithms`` which can be found on PyPi or on Github here:

    https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-algorithms

    The :mod:`qiskit.algorithms` module will continue to work as before and bug fixes
    will be made to it until its future removal, but active development
    of new features has moved to the new package.
    If you're relying on :mod:`qiskit.algorithms` you should update your
    Python requirements to also include ``qiskit-algorithms`` and update the imports
    from ``qiskit.algorithms`` to ``qiskit_algorithms`` in your code. If you have not yet
    migrated from ``QuantumInstance``-based to primitives-based algorithms,
    you should follow the migration guidelines in https://qisk.it/algo_migration.
    The decision to migrate the :mod:`~.algorithms` module to a 
    separate package was made to clarify the purpose Qiskit and 
    make a distinction between the tools and libraries built on top of it.
