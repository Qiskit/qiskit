    The method :meth:`~qiskit.circuit.Instruction.qasm` and all overriding methods of subclasses
    of `:class:~qiskit.circuit.Instruction` are deprecated. There is no replacement for generating
    an OpenQASM2 string for an isolated instruction as typically
    a single instruction object has insufficient context to completely
    generate a valid OpenQASM2 string. If you're relying on this
    method currently you'll have to instead rely on the OpenQASM2
    exporter:  :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.qasm` to generate the OpenQASM2
    for an entire circuit object.
