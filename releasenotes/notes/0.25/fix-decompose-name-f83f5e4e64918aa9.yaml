    Fixed an issue in the :func:`.QuantumCircuit.decompose` method
    where passing a circuit name to the function that matched a
    composite gate name would not decompose the gate if it had a label
    assigned to it as well.
    Fixed `#9136 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/9136>`__
