    The Sabre family of transpiler passes (namely :class:`.SabreLayout`
    and :class:`.SabreSwap`) are now used by default for all circuits
    when invoking the transpiler at optimization level 1 (e.g. calling
    :func:`.transpile` or :func:`.generate_preset_pass_manager` with 
    keyword argument ``optimization_level=1``). Previously, circuits
    with control flow operations used :class:`.DenseLayout` and
    :class:`.StochasticSwap` with this profile.
