    Initializing a :class:`~qiskit.pulse.library.ScalableSymbolicPulse` with complex value for ``amp``.
    This change also affects the following library pulses:

      * :class:`~qiskit.pulse.library.Gaussian`
      * :class:`~qiskit.pulse.library.GaussianSquare`
      * :class:`~qiskit.pulse.library.Drag`
      * :class:`~qiskit.pulse.library.Constant`

    Initializing ``amp`` for these with a complex value is now deprecated as well.

    Instead, use two floats when specifying the ``amp`` and ``angle`` parameters, where ``amp`` represents the
    magnitude of the complex amplitude, and `angle` represents the angle of the complex amplitude. i.e. the
    complex amplitude is given by :math:`\texttt{amp} \times \exp(i \times \texttt{angle})`.
