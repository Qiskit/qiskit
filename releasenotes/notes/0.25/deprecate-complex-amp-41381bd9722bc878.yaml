    Initializing a :class:`~qiskit.pulse.library.ScalableSymbolicPulse` with complex `amp` value is now deprecated.
    This change also affects the following library pulses:

      * :class:`~qiskit.pulse.library.Gaussian`
      * :class:`~qiskit.pulse.library.GaussianSquare`
      * :class:`~qiskit.pulse.library.Drag`
      * :class:`~qiskit.pulse.library.Constant`

    Initializing them with complex `amp` is now deprecated as well.

    Instead, one should use two floats for the `amp` and `angle` parameters, where `amp` represents the
    magnitude of the complex amplitude, and `angle` represents the angle of the complex amplitude. i.e. the
    complex amplitude is given by `amp` * exp(1j * `angle`).
