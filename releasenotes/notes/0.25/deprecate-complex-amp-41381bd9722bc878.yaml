    Initializing a :class:`~qiskit.pulse.library.ScalableSymbolicPulse` with complex value for `amp`.
    This change also affects the following library pulses:

      * :class:`~qiskit.pulse.library.Gaussian`
      * :class:`~qiskit.pulse.library.GaussianSquare`
      * :class:`~qiskit.pulse.library.Drag`
      * :class:`~qiskit.pulse.library.Constant`

    Initializing `amp` for these with a complex value is now deprecated as well.

    Instead, use two floats when specifying the `amp` and `angle` parameters, where `amp` represents the
    magnitude of the complex amplitude, and `angle` represents the angle of the complex amplitude. i.e. the
    complex amplitude is given by `amp` * exp(1j * `angle`).
