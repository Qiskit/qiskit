    Added a new function :func:`~qiskit.pulse.library.gaussian_square_echo` to the
    pulse library. The returned pulse
    is composed of three :class:`~qiskit.pulse.library.GaussianSquare` pulses. The 
    first two are echo pulses with duration half of the total duration and
    implement rotary tones. The third pulse is a cancellation tone that lasts
    the full duration of the pulse and implements correcting single qubit
    rotations.
