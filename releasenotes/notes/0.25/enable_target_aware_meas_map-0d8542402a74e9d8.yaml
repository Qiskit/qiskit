    Added the attribute :attr:`.Target.concurrent_measurements` which represents a hardware
    constraint of qubits measured concurrently. This constraint is provided in a nested list form,
    in which each element represents a qubit group to be measured together. 
    In an example below::
    
        [[0, 1], [2, 3, 4]]
     
    qubits 0 and 1, and 2, 3 and 4 are measured together on the device.
    This constraint doesn't block measuring an individual qubit, but you may
    need to consider the alignment of measure operations for these qubits when
    working with the
    `Qiskit Pulse scheduler <https://qiskit.org/documentation/tutorials/circuits_advanced/07_pulse_scheduler.html>`__
    and when authoring new transpiler passes that are timing-aware (i.e. passes
    that perform scheduling).
