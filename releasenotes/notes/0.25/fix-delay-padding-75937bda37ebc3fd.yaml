    Fixed an issue in tranpiler passes for padding delays, which did not respect target constraints
    resulting in inserted delays even for qubits not supporting the :class:`~.circuit.Delay` instruction.
    :class:`~.PadDelay` and :class:`~.PadDynamicalDecoupling` are fixed
    so that they do not pad any idle time of qubits that don't support the :class:`~.circuit.Delay` instruction.
    Also legacy scheduling passes :class:`~qiskit.transpiler.passes.ASAPSchedule` and :class:`~qiskit.transpiler.passes.ALAPSchedule`
    (which pad delays internally) are fixed in the same way.
    In addition, :func:`.transpile` is fixed to call :class:`~.PadDelay` with a ``target`` object
    so that things work correctly when called with the ``scheduling_method`` option.
    Fixed `#9993 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/9993>`__
