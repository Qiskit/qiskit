    The :class:`~qiskit.pulse.library.SymbolicPulse` library was extended. The new pulse functions
    in the library are:

      * :func:`~qiskit.pulse.library.GaussianDeriv`
      * :func:`~qiskit.pulse.library.Sech`
      * :func:`~qiskit.pulse.library.SechDeriv`
      * :func:`~qiskit.pulse.library.Square`

    The new functions return a :class:`~qiskit.pulse.library.ScalableSymbolicPulse` instance, and match the functionality
    of the corresponding functions in the discrete pulse library, with the exception of
    :func:`~qiskit.pulse.library.Square` for which a phase of :math:`2\pi` shifts by a full cycle (contrary to the
    discrete :func:`~qiskit.pulse.library.square` where such a shift was induced by a :math:`\pi` phase).
