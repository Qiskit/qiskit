    The OpenQASM 3 exporter (:mod:`qiskit.qasm3`) will no longer output invalid OpenQASM 3 for
    non-unitary :class:`~.circuit.Instruction` instances, but will instead raise a
    :exc:`.QASM3ExporterError` explaining that this are not yet supported.  This feature will is
    slated for a later release of Qiskit, when there are more classical-processing facilities
    throughout the library.
