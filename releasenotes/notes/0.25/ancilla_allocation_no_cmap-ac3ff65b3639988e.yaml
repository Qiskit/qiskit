    Fixed an issue with using :class:`~.Target`\ s without coupling maps with the :class:`~.FullAncillaAllocation` transpiler pass.
    In this case, :class:`~.FullAncillaAllocation` will now add
    ancilla qubits so that the number of qubits in the :class:`~.DAGCircuit` matches
    that of :attr:`Target.num_qubits`.
