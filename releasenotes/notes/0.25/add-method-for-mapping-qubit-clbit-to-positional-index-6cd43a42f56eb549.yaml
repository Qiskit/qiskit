    A new method :meth:`~qiskit.dagcircuit.DAGCircuit.find_bit` has
    been added to the :class:`~qiskit.dagcircuit.DAGCircuit` class,
    which returns the bit locations of the given :class:`.Qubit` or
    :class:`.Clbit` as a tuple of the positional index of the bit within
    the circuit and a list of tuples which locate the bit in the circuit's
    registers.
