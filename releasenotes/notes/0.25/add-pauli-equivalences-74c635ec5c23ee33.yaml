    The transpiler's built-in :class:`.EquivalenceLibrary` has been taught the circular Pauli
    relations :math:`X = iZY`, :math:`Y = iXZ` and :math:`Z = iYX`.  This should make transpiling
    to constrained, and potentially incomplete, basis sets more reliable.
    See `#10293 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/10293>`__ for more detail.
