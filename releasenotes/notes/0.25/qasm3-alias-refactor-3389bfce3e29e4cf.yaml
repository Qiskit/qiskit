    The OpenQASM 3 exporters (:func:`.qasm3.dump`, :func:`~.qasm3.dumps` and :class:`~.qasm3.Exporter`)
    have a new ``allow_aliasing`` argument, which will eventually replace the ``alias_classical_registers``
    argument.  This controls whether aliasing is permitted for either classical bits or qubits, rather
    than the option only being available for classical bits.

  - |
    The OpenQASM 3 exporters (:func:`.qasm3.dump`, :func:`~.qasm3.dumps` and :class:`~.qasm3.Exporter`)
    will now use fewer "register alias" definitions in its output.  The circuit described will not
    change, but it will now preferentially export in terms of direct ``bit``, ``qubit`` and
    ``qubit[n]`` types rather than producing a ``_loose_bits`` register and aliasing more registers
    off this.  This is done to minimise the number of advanced OpenQASM 3 features in use, and to
    avoid introducing unnecessary array structure into programmes that do not require it.
