    The transpiler pass :class:`~qiskit.transpiler.passes.SetLayout` can now
    be constructed with a list of integers that represent the physical qubits
    on which the quantum circuit will be mapped on. That is, the first qubit
    in the circuit will be allocated to the physical qubit in position zero
    of the list, and so on.
