    Reduced overhead of the :class:`.ConsolidateBlocks` pass by performing matrix operations
    on all two-qubit blocks instead of creating an instance of :class:`.QuantumCircuit` and
    passing it to an :class:`.Operator`. 
    The speedup will only be applicable when consolidating two-qubit blocks. Anything higher 
    than that will still be handled by the :class:`.Operator` class.
    Check `#8779 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/8779>`__ for details.
