features:
  - |
    Added utility function :func:`qiskit.transpiler.passes.utils._block_to_matrix` that can 
    generate a matrix based on a block of operations between two qubits. This function can
    be used in transpiler passes that work on some decomposed circuits such as :class:`.ConsolidateBlocks`. 
fixes:
  - |
    Reduced overhead of the :class:`.ConsolidateBlocks` pass by performing matrix operations
    on all two-qubit blocks using :func:`qiskit.transpiler.passes.utils._block_to_matrix` 
    instead of creating an instance of :class:`.QuantumCircuit` and passing it to an :class:`.Operator`. 
    The speedup will only be applicable when consolidating two-qubit blocks. Anything higher 
    than that will still be handled by the :class:`.Operator` class.
