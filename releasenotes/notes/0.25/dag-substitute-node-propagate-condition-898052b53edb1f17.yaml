    :meth:`.DAGCircuit.substitute_node` gained a ``propagate_condition`` keyword argument that is
    analogous to the same argument in :meth:`~.DAGCircuit.substitute_node_with_dag`.  Setting this
    to ``False`` opts out of the legacy behaviour of copying a condition on the ``node`` onto the
    new ``op`` that is replacing it.

    This option is ignored for general control-flow operations, which will never propagate their
    condition, nor accept a condition from another node.
fixes:
  - |
    :meth:`.DAGCircuit.substitute_node` will no longer silently overwrite an existing condition on
    the given replacement ``op``.  If ``propagate_condition`` is set to ``True`` (the default), a
    :exc:`.DAGCircuitError` will be raised instead.
