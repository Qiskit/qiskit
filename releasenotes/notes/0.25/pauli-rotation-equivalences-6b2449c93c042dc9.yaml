    The transpiler's built-in :class:`.EquivalenceLibrary` has been taught more Pauli-rotation
    equivalences between the one-qubit :math:`R_X`, :math:`R_Y` and :math:`R_Z` gates, and between
    the two-qubit :math:`R_{XX}`, :math:`R_{YY}` and :math:`R_{ZZ}` gates.  This should make
    simple basis translations more reliable, especially circuits that use :math:`Y` rotations.
