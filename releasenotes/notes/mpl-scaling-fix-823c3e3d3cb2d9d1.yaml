    The matplotlib (mpl) drawer was not properly scaling when the kwarg
    ``scale`` was set in the QuantumCircuit.draw method. Fonts and linewidths
    did not scale with the rest of the image. All elements of the circuit
    scale properly now.

    Fixes issue `#4179 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/4179>`_.

    For example:

    .. jupyter-execute::

        from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
        circuit = QuantumCircuit(2)
        circuit.h(0)
        circuit.cx(0, 1)
        circuit.draw(output='mpl', scale=0.5)
