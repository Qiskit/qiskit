    Fixes a bug in the function ``_multigate_opt``. When a gate and its
    previous gate combine to the identity, and the gate and its next gate also
    combine to the identity, the gate would be removed twice. Refer to
    `#7271 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/7271>` for more
    details.
