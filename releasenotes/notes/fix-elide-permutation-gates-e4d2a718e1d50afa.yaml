    Fixed an issue in the :class:`.ElidePermutations` transpiler pass, where
    the output permutation was not updated correctly in the presence of
    :class:`.PermutationGate` operations. This would result in an incorrect
    output circuit and an incorrect ``virtual_permutation_layout`` property in the
    :attr:`~.PassManager.property_set` being set. When run as part of a larger
    :class:`~.transpiler.PassManager` this would also result in an incorrect
    :class:`.TranspileLayout` being returned in the
    :attr:`.QuantumCircuit.layout` in the output circuit.
