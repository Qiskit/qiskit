    Added a new method :meth:`qiskit.quantum_info.Operator.equal_with_ancillas`
    which checks the equality of two operators in the subspace where ancilla
    qubits are zero. For example::

        from qiskit.circuit import QuantumCircuit
        from qiskit.quantum_info import Operator

        qc1 = QuantumCircuit(4)
        qc1.x(0)
        qc1.x(2)
        qc1.cx(1, 0)
        qc1.cx(1, 2)
        qc1.cx(1, 3)
        op1 = Operator(qc1)

        qc2 = QuantumCircuit(4)
        qc2.x(0)
        qc2.x(2)
        op2 = Operator(qc2)

        assert op1 != op2
        assert op1.equal_with_ancillas(op2, [1])

    The first assertion is ``False`` because the two circuits are different.
    The second assertion is ``True`` because the CX-gates do not matter if
    qubit ``1`` is initially zero.
