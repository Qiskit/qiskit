prelude:
    The transpiler now supports directly targeting a broader range of
    device basis sets, including backends implementing the CZ and
    iSwap gates.
features:
  - |
    A new ``translation_method`` keyword argument has been added to
    ``qiskit.transpile`` to allow selection of the method to be used
    for translating circuits to the available device gates. For example,
    ``transpile(circ, backend, translation_method='translator')``. Valid
    choices are ``'unroller'`` to use the ``Unroller`` pass and
    ``'translator'`` to use the ``BasisTranslator`` pass. The default value
    is ``'translator'``.
