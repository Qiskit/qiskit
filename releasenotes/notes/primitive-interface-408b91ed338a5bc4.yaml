    The primitives interface has been extended to accept objects in addition to indices
    as arguments to the `__call__` method and `parameter_values` can be optional.
deprecations:
  - |
    The arguments' names in :meth:`~qiskit.primitives.Estimator.__call__` and
    :meth:`~qiskit.primitives.Sampler.__call__` are renamed from `circuit_indices`
    and `observable_indices` to `circuits` and `observables`.
