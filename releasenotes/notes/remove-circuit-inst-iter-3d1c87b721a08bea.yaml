    :class:`~.circuit.CircuitInstruction` is no longer tuple-like nor iterable,
    which was deprecated in Qiskit 1.2. Instead, use the
    :class:`~.circuit.CircuitInstruction.operation`,
    :class:`~.circuit.CircuitInstruction.qubits`, and
    :class:`~.circuit.CircuitInstruction.clbits` named attributes.
