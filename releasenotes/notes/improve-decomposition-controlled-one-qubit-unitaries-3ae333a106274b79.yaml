    Reduce the number of two-qubit gates when decomposing some multi-controlled
    single-qubit unitary gates. For example,

    * For multi-controlled :class:`.YGate` on 10 qubits, we reduce the :class:`.CXGate` count by 56%,
    * For multi-controlled :class:`.HGate` on 10 qubits, we reduce the :class:`.CXGate` count by 56%,
    * For multi-controlled :class:`.SXGate` and :class:`.SXdgGate` on 10 qubits, we reduce the :class:`.CXGate` count by 80%,
    * For multi-controlled :class:`.UGate` on 10 qubits, we reduce the :class:`.CXGate` count by 31%.
