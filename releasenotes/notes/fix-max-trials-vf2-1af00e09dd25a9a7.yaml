    Fixed the behavior of the ``max_trials`` argument for :class:`.VF2Layout`
    when set to ``None`` or a negative number. The pass was documented as
    limiting the search to be based on the size of the circuit or target
    if the option was set to ``None``, and as accepting negative values to
    specify an unbounded search. However, in 2.1.0 this behavior was
    incorrectly changed so that ``None`` ran an unbounded search and 
    using a negative number would raise an error. These oversights have
    been corrected so that the pass behaves as documented and is consistent
    with previous releases.
