    The following layout and routing transpiler passes from the
    :mod:`.qiskit.transpiler.passes` modules now will support accepting a
    :class:`~.Target` object which is used to model the constraints of a target
    backend via the first positional argument (currently named either
    ``coupling_map`` or ``backend_properties``).

    The list of these passes with the support for new ``target`` argument are:

      * :class:`~.CSPLayout`
      * :class:`~.FullAncillaAllocation`
      * :class:`~.Layout2qDistance`
      * :class:`~.NoiseAdaptiveLayout`
      * :class:`~.SabreLayout`
      * :class:`~.TrivialLayout`
      * :class:`~.BasicSwap`
      * :class:`~.BIPMapping`
      * :class:`~.LayoutTransformation`
      * :class:`~.LookaheadSwap`
      * :class:`~.SabreSwap`
      * :class:`~.StochasticSwap`
      * :class:`~.CheckMap`

    The pass manager construction helper function :func:`~.generate_embed_passmanager`
    will now also accept a :class:`~.Target` for it's sole positional argument
    (currently named ``coupling_map``). This can be used to construct a layout
    embedding :class:`~.PassManager` from a :class:`~.Target` object instead of
    from a :class:`~.CouplingMap`.
