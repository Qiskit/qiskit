    The :class:`~.DefaultUnitarySynthesis` transpiler pass now chooses
    one and two-qubit unitary synthesis based on the basis errors, if they
    are reported in the target. In particular, it runs all possible synthesis
    and chooses the cheapest option.
    For a one-qubit decomposition, it can target Pauli basis
    (e.g. RZ-RX-RZ or RZ-RY-RZ), generic unitary basis (e.g. U), and a
    few others.
    For a two-qubit decomposition, it can target any supercontrolled basis
    (e.g. CNOT, iSWAP, B) or multiple controlled basis 
    (e.g. CZ, CH, ZZ^.5, ZX^.2, etc.).
