    :class:`Statevector` and :class:`DensityMatrix` classes now have ``.draw()`` methods
    allowing them to be drawn as text matrices, IPython Latex objects, Latex source,
    Q-spheres, Bloch spheres and Hinton plots. Default draw type is the ASCII `_repr_`
    of the state, but this can be changed in `~/.qiskit/settings.conf` by adding the line
    `state_drawer = <option>`. This draw method is used in `_ipython_display_`, so setting
    the default draw type will also be displayed when the last line of a notebook evaluates
    to a `Statevector` or `DensityMatrix`.

    .. jupyter-execute::

            from qiskit.quantum_info import DensityMatrix
            dm = DensityMatrix.from_label('r0')
            dm.draw('latex')

    .. jupyter-execute::

            from qiskit.quantum_info import Statevector
            sv = Statevector.from_label('+r')
            sv.draw('qsphere')
