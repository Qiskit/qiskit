    :class:`Statevector` and :class:`DensityMatrix` classes now have :meth:`__ipython_dispay__`
    methods for viewing in Jupyter Notebooks and other environments that support
    it.

    .. jupyter-execute::

            from qiskit.quantum_info import Statevector
            Statevector.from_label('+r')

  - |
    :class:`Statevector` and :class:`DensityMatrix` classes now have ``.draw()`` methods
    allowing them to be drawn as text matrices, IPython Latex objects, Latex source,
    Q-spheres, Bloch spheres and Hinton plots.

    .. jupyter-execute::

            from qiskit.quantum_info import Statevector
            sv = Statevector.from_label('+r')
            sv.draw('qsphere')
