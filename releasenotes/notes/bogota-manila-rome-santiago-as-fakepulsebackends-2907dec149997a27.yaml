    The ``FakeBogota``, ``FakeManila``, ``FakeRome``, and ``FakeSantiago`` fake backends which can be found
    in the ``qiskit.test.mock`` module can now be used as backends in Pulse experiments as they now include
    a :class:`~qiskit.providers.models.PulseDefaults` created from a snapshot of the IBM Quantum's properties.
