    Fixed a bad deprecation of :attr:`.Register.name_format` which had made the class attribute
    available only from instances and not the class.  When trying to send dynamic-circuits jobs to
    hardware backends, this would frequently cause the error::

      AttributeError: 'property' object has no attribute 'match'

    Fixed `#9493 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/9493>`__.
