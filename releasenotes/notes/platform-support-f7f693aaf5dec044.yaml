    The ``symengine`` library is now a hard requirement for all platforms.
    Previously, ``symengine`` was required only on platforms that had
    pre-compiled packages available and ``sympy`` would be used as a fallback
    if it wasn't installed. These split requirements were resulting in increased
    complexity, as it was necessary to determine which libraries were installed
    to debug an issue. Requiring ``symengine`` for all systems greatly decreases
    the complexity and optimizes Qiskit for higher performance. However,
    users on i686 Linux, 32 bit Windows, and s390x Linux (the platforms without
    precompiled packages on PyPI) will need to build symengine from source.

    Support for 32 bit platforms, i686 Linux and 32 bit Windows, on
    Python < 3.10 has been downgraded from Tier 2 to Tier 3, as documented in
    the `platform support page <https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/start/install#operating-system-support>`_. This is a consequence of making
    ``symengine`` required for all users, as there is a lack of pre-compiled packages 
    available for these platforms, so users will need to build symengine from
    source.

    For macOS users, the minimum version of macOS is now 10.12. Previously, the
    precompiled binary wheel packages for macOS x86_64 were published with
    support for >=10.9. However, because of changes in the
    `support policy <https://blog.rust-lang.org/2023/09/25/Increasing-Apple-Version-Requirements.html>`__
    for the Rust programming language the minimum version needed to raised
    to macOS 10.12. If you're using Qiskit on macOS 10.9 you can probably
    build Qiskit from source while the Qiskit MSRV (minimum supported Rust
    version) is < 1.74, but the precompiled binaries published to PyPI will
    only be compatible with macOS >= 10.12.
