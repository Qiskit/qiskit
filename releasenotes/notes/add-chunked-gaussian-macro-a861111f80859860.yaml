features:
  - |
    Two symbolic pulse factories :func:`.GaussianFallEdge` and :func:`.GaussianRiseEdge`
    have been added to the pulse library. These pulses are expected to
    be used by the pulse chunking macros.
  - |
    A pulse macro function :func:`~.qiskit.pulse.macros.chunking_gaussian_square`
    has been added. This function generates a pulse schedule of a single
    Gaussian square pulse which is divided into multiple pieces.
    This representation may allow the backend pulse controller to efficiently store
    the full waveform of very long Gaussian square pulse in its waveform memory,
    and may enable experimentalists to efficiently write a particular experiment program
    requiring long pulse irradiation, such as resonator spectroscopy.
