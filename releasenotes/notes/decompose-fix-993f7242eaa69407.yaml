fixes:
  - Fixed an issue in :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.decompose` method when
    passing in a list of ``Gate`` classes for the ``gates_to_decompose``
    argument. If any gates in the circuit had a label set this argument
    wouldn't be handled correctly and caused the output decomposition to
    incorrectly skip gates explicitly in the ``gates_to_decompose`` list.
