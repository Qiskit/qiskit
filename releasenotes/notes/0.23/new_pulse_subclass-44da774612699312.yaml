features:
  - |
    Introduced a new subclass :class:`~qiskit.pulse.library.ScalableSymbolicPulse`, as a
    subclass of :class:`~qiskit.pulse.library.SymbolicPulse`. The new subclass behaves
    the same as :class:`~qiskit.pulse.library.SymbolicPulse`,
    except that it assumes that the envelope of the pulse includes a complex amplitude
    pre-factor of the form :math:`\text{amp} * e^{i \times \text{angle}}`.
    This envelope shape matches many common pulses, including all of the pulses in
    the Qiskit Pulse library (which were also converted to ``amp``, ``angle`` representation in
    this release).

    The new subclass removes the non-unique nature of the ``amp``, ``angle`` representation,
    and correctly compares pulses according to their complex amplitude.
upgrade:
  - |
    The QPY version format version emitted by :func:`~.qpy.dump` has been
    increased to version 6. This new format version is incompatible with the
    previous versions and will result in an error when trying to load it with
    a deserializer that isn't able to handle QPY version 6. This change was
    necessary to support the introduction of :class:`~qiskit.pulse.library.ScalableSymbolicPulse`
    which was handled by adding a ``class_name_size`` attribute to the header
    of the dumped :class:`~qiskit.pulse.library.SymbolicPulse` objects.
  - |
    The ``__hash__`` method for the :class:`~qiskit.pulse.library.SymbolicPulse` was removed.
    This was done to reflect the mutable nature (via parameter assignment) of this class
    which could result in errors when using :class:`~qiskit.pulse.library.SymbolicPulse`
    in situtations where a hashable object was required. This means the builtin ``hash()``
    method and using :class:`~qiskit.pulse.library.SymbolicPulse` as keys in dictionaries
    or set members will no longer work.
