  - |
    The previously deprecated functions: ``qiskit.circuit.measure.measure()``
    and ``qiskit.circuit.reset.reset()`` have been removed. These functions
    were deprecated in the Qiskit Terra 0.19.0 release (December, 2021).
    Instead you should use the :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.measure` and
    :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.reset` methods of the :class:`~.QuantumCircuit`
    object you wish to append a :class:`~.Measure` or :class:`~.Reset`
    operation to.
