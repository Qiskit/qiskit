    Add new :class:`~qiskit.pulse.GaussianSquareDrag` pulse shape. This pulse
    shape is similar to :class:`~qiskit.pulse.GaussianSquare` but uses the
    :class:`~qiskit.pulse.Drag` shape during its rise and fall. The correction
    from the DRAG pulse shape can suppress part of the frequency spectrum of
    the rise and fall of the pulse which can help avoid exciting spectator
    qubits when they are close in frequency to the drive frequency of the
    pulse.
