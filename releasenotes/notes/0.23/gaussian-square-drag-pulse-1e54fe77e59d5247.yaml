    Add new :class:`~.GaussianSquareDrag` pulse shape to the :mod:`qiskit.pulse.library`
    module. This pulse shape is similar to :class:`~.GaussianSquare` but uses
    the :class:`~.Drag` shape during its rise and fall. The correction
    from the DRAG pulse shape can suppress part of the frequency spectrum of
    the rise and fall of the pulse which can help avoid exciting spectator
    qubits when they are close in frequency to the drive frequency of the
    pulse.
