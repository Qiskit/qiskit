    The ``initial_state`` argument for the constructor of the
    :class:`~.NLocal` class along with assigning directly to
    the :class:`.NLocal.initial_state` atrribute must be a
    :class:`~.QuantumCircuit` now. Support for using other types
    for this argument and attribute is no longer supported. Support
    for other types was deprecated as part of the Qiskit Terra 0.18.0
    release (July 2021).
