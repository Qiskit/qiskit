fixes:
  - |
    Fixed an issue with the :meth:`.Target.build_coupling_map` method where
    it would incorrectly return ``None`` for a :class:`~.Target` object
    with a mix of ideal globally available instructions and instructions
    that have qubit constraints. Now in such cases the
    :meth:`.Target.build_coupling_map` will return a coupling map for the
    constrained instruction (unless it's a 2 qubit operation which will
    return ``None`` because globally there is no connectivity constraint).
    Fixed `#8971 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/8971>`__

    Fixed an issue with the :attr:`.Target.qargs` attribute where it would
    incorrectly return ``None`` for a :class:`~.Target` object that contained
    any globally available ideal instruction.
