    The output :class:`~.QuasiDistribution` from the :class:`.Sampler.run`
    method has been updated to filter out any states with a probability of
    zero. Now if a valid state is missing from the dictionary output it can
    be assumed to have a 0 probability. Previously, all possible outcomes for
    a given number of bits (e.g. for a 3 bit result ``000``, ``001``,
    ``010``, ``011``, ``100``, ``101``, ``110``, and ``111``) even if the
    probability of a given state was 0. This change was made to reduce the
    size of the output as for larger number of bits the output size could be
    quite large. Also, filtering the zero probability results makes the output
    consistent with other implementations of :class:`~.BaseSampler`.
