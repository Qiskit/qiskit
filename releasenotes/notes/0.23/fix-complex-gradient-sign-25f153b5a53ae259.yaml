    Fixed the documentation in :class:`.LinCombEstimatorGradient` to correctly 
    show the derivative applied on the ket-side of the expectation 
    value. Previously, the derivative had been documented in the bra-side, which
    led to a sign swap for gradients in the ``IMAG`` and ``COMPLEX`` 
    cases of the :class:`.DerivativeType`.
