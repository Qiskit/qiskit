  - |
    The previously deprecated :class:`.ParameterView` methods which were
    inherited from ``set`` have been removed from :class:`.ParameterView`,
    the type returned by :attr:`.QuantumCircuit.parameters`. The specific
    methods which have been removed are:

      * ``add()``
      * ``difference()``
      * ``difference_update()``
      * ``discard()``
      * ``intersection()``
      * ``intersection_update()``
      * ``issubset()``
      * ``issuperset()``
      * ``symmetric_difference()``
      * ``symmetric_difference_update()``
      * ``union()``
      * ``update()``

    along with support for the Python operators:

      * ``ixor``: ``^=``
      * ``isub``: ``-=``
      * ``ior``: ``|=``

    These were deprecated in the Qiskit Terra 0.17.0 release (April, 2021).
    The :class:`.ParameterView` type is now a general sequence view type and doesn't
    support these ``set`` operations any longer.
