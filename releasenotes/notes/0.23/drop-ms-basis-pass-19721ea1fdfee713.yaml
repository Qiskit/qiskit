upgrade:
  - |
    The previously deprecated ``MSBasisDecomposer`` transpiler pass available
    via the :mod:`qiskit.transpiler.passes` module has been removed. It was
    originally deprecated as part of the Qiskit Terra 0.16.0 release
    (10-16-2020). Instead the :class:`~.BasisTranslator` transpiler pass
    should be used instead to translate a circuit into an appropriate basis
    with a :class:`~.RXXGate`
