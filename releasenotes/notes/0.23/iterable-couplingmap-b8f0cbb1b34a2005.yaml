    :class:`.CouplingMap` is now implicitly iterable, with the iteration being
    identical to iterating through the output of :meth:`.CouplingMap.get_edges()`.
    In other words,

    .. code-block:: python

      from qiskit.transpiler import CouplingMap
      coupling = CouplingMap.from_line(3)
      list(coupling) == list(coupling.get_edges())

    will now function as expected, as will other iterations.  This is purely a
    syntactic convenience.
