    :class:`.InstructionScheduleMap` has been updated to store backend calibration data
    in the format of PulseQobj JSON and invokes conversion when the data is accessed
    for the first time, i.e. lazy conversion.
    This internal logic update drastically improves the performance of loading backend
    especially with many calibration entries.

    New module :mod:`qiskit.pulse.calibration_entries` has been added. This
    contains several wrapper classes for different pulse schedule representations.

    * :class:`~.ScheduleDef`
    * :class:`~.CallableDef`
    * :class:`~.PulseQobjDef`

    These classes implement the :meth:`~.ScheduleDef.get_schedule` and
    :meth:`~.ScheduleDef.get_signature` methods that returns pulse schedule
    and parameter names to assign, respectively. These classes are internally
    managed by the :class:`.InstructionScheduleMap` or backend :class:`~.Target`,
    and thus they will not appear in a typical user programs.
