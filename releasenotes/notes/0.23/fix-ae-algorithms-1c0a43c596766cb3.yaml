    Fixed an issue with  the amplitude estimation algorithms in the
    ``qiskit.algorithms.amplitude_estimators`` module (see :ref:`amplitude_estimators`) for
    the usage with primitives built from the abstract :class:`.BaseSampler` primitive (such
    as :class:`~.Sampler` and :class:`~.BackendSampler`). Previously, the measurement
    results were expanded to more bits than actually measured which for oracles with more
    than one qubit led to potential errors in the detection of the "good" quantum states
    for oracles.
