    Fixed an issue where :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.add_calibrations` and
    :meth:`.DAGCircuit.add_calibrations` methods had a mismatch in
    their behavior of parameter formatting logic. Previously
    :meth:`.DAGCircuit.add_calibrations` tried to cast every parameter
    into ``float``, :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.add_calibrations` used given
    parameters as-is. This would potentially cause an error when running
    :func:`~.transpile` was run on a :class:`~.QuantumCircuit` with pulse
    gates as the parameters of the calibrations could be kept as
    :class:`~.ParameterExpresion` objects.
