    Zero-operand gates and instructions will now work with
    :func:`.circuit_to_gate`, :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.to_gate`,
    :meth:`.Gate.control`, and the construction of an
    :class:`~.quantum_info.Operator` from a :class:`.QuantumCircuit` containing
    zero-operand instructions.  This edge case is occasionally useful in creating
    global-phase gates as part of larger compound instructions, though for many
    uses, :attr:`.QuantumCircuit.global_phase` may be more appropriate.
