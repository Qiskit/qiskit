deprecations:
  - |
    The ``qiskit.visualization.state_visualization.num_to_latex_ket()``
    and ``qiskit.visualization.state_visualization.num_to_latex_terms()``
    functions have been deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
    These function were primarily used internally by the LaTeX output from
    :meth:`.Statevector.draw` and :meth:`.DensityMatrix.draw` which no longer
    are using these function and are leverging
    `sympy <https://pypi.org/project/sympy/>`__ for this instead. If you were
    using these functions you should cosinder using Sympy's
    `nsimplify() <https://docs.sympy.org/latest/modules/simplify/simplify.html>`__
    `latex() <https://docs.sympy.org/latest/modules/printing.html>`__ functions.
upgrade:
  - |
    The LaTeX array drawers (e.g. ``array_to_latex``,
    ``Statevector.draw('latex')``) now use the same sympy function as the
    ket-convention drawer. This means it may render some numbers differently
    to previous releases, but will provide a more consistent experience.
    For example, it may identify new factors, or rationalize denominators where
    it did not previously. The default ``precision`` has been changed from 5 to
    10.
