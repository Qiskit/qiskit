    The pulses in :mod:`qiskit.pulse.library`

      * :class:`~qiskit.pulse.library.Gaussian`
      * :class:`~qiskit.pulse.library.GaussianSquare`
      * :class:`~qiskit.pulse.library.Drag`
      * :class:`~qiskit.pulse.library.Constant`

    can be initialized with new parameter ``angle``, such that two float parameters could be provided:
    ``amp`` and ``angle``. Initialization with complex ``amp`` is still supported.

    When initializing any of the pulse classes in :mod:`qiskit.pulse.library`:

      * :class:`~qiskit.pulse.library.Gaussian`
      * :class:`~qiskit.pulse.library.GaussianSquare`
      * :class:`~qiskit.pulse.library.Drag`
      * :class:`~qiskit.pulse.library.Constant`

    providing a complex ``amp`` argument with a finite ``angle`` will result in
    :class:`~.PulseError` now. For example, instead of calling ``Gaussian(duration=100,sigma=20,amp=0.5j)`` one
    should use ``Gaussian(duration=100,sigma=20,amp=0.5,angle=np.pi/2)`` instead now. The pulse envelope
    which used to be defined as ``amp * ...`` is in turn defined as ``amp * exp(1j * angle) * ...``.
    This change was made to better support `Qiskit Experiments <https://qiskit.org/documentation/experiments/>`__
    where the amplitude and angle of pulses are calibrated in separate experiments.
