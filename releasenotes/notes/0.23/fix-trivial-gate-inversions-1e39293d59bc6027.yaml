    Added support to the :class:`~.GateDirection` transpiler pass to
    handle the the symmetric :class:`~.RXXGate`, :class:`~.RYYGate`, and
    :class:`~.RZZGate` gates. The pass will now correctly handle these gates
    and simply reverse the qargs order in place without any other
    modifications.
