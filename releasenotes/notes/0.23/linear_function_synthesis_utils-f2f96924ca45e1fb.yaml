    Added a new function :func:`~.synth_cnot_count_full_pmh` which is used to
    synthesize linear reversible circuits for all-to-all architectures
    using the Patel, Markov and Hayes method. This function is identical to
    the available ``qiskit.transpiler.synthesis.cnot_synth()``
    function but has a more descriptive name and is more logically placed
    in the package tree. This new function supersedes the legacy function
    which will likely be deprecated in a future release.
