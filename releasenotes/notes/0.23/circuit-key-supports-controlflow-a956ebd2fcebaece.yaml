    Fixed support in the :mod:`~.qiskit.primitives` module for running
    :class:`~.QuantumCircuit` objects with control flow instructions (e.g.
    :class:`~.IfElseOp`). Previously, the :class:`~BaseSampler` and
    :class:`~BaseEstimator` base classes could not correctly
    normalize such circuits. However, executing these circuits is dependent
    on the particular implementation of the primitive supporting control
    flow instructions. This just fixed support to enable a particular
    implementation of :class:`~BaseSampler` or :class:`~BaseEstimator`
    to use control flow instructions.
