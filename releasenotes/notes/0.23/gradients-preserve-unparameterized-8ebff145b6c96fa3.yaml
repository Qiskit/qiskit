    All gradient classes in :mod:`qiskit.algorithms.gradients` now preserve unparameterized
    operations instead of attempting to unroll them. This allows to evaluate gradients on
    custom, opaque gates that individual primitives can handle and keeps a higher
    level of abstraction for optimized synthesis and compilation after the gradient circuits
    have been constructed.

    Added a :class:`.TranslateParameterizedGates` pass to map only parameterized gates in a 
    circuit to a specified basis, but leave unparameterized gates untouched. The pass first
    attempts unrolling and finally translates if a parameterized gate cannot be further unrolled.
