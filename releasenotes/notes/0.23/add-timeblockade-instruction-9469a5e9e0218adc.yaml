    Added a new pulse directive :class:`~qiskit.pulse.instructions.TimeBlockade`.
    This directive behaves almost identically to the delay instruction, but will
    be removed before execution. This directive is intended to be used internally
    within the pulse builder and helps :class:`.ScheduleBlock` represent
    instructions with absolute time intervals. This allows the pulse builder to
    convert :class:`Schedule` into :class:`ScheduleBlock`, rather than wrapping
    with :class:`~qiskit.pulse.instructions.Call` instructions.
