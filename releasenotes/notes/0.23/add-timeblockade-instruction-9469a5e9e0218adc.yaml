    New pulse directive :class:`~qiskit.pulse.instructions.TimeBlockade` has been added.
    This instruction is QPY compatible. This directive behaves almost identically to
    the delay instruction, but will be removed before execution.
    This directive is intended to be used internally within the pulse builder
    and helps :class:`.ScheduleBlock` represent instructions with
    absolute time intervals. This allows the pulse builder to convert
    :class:`Schedule` into :class:`ScheduleBlock`, rather than wrapping with call instruction.
