  - |
    The previously deprecated ``gate`` argument to the constructor of the
    :class:`~.Decompose` transpiler pass, along with its matching attribute
    ``Decompose.gate`` have been removed. The argument and attribute were
    deprecated as part of the Qiskit Terra 0.19.0 release (December, 2021).
    Instead the ``gates_to_decompose`` argument for the constructor along
    with the :attr:`.Decompose.gates_to_decompose` attribute should be used
    instead. The ``gates_to_decompose`` argument and attribute should function
    the same, but has a more explicit name and also enables specifying lists
    of gates instead of only supporting a single gate.
