fixes:

    The method :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.compose` now accepts the same set of qubit and clbit
    specifiers as other :class:`.QuantumCircuit` methods, such as :meth:`~.QuantumCircuit.append`.
    This means, for example, that Numpy integers will work.  Fixed `#8691
    <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/8691>`__.

    Fixed :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.compose` incorrectly mapping registers in conditions on the given
    circuit to complete registers on the base.  Previously, the mapping was very imprecise; the bits
    used within each condition were not subject to the mapping, and instead an inaccurate attempt was
    made to find a corresponding register.  This could also result in a condition on a smaller register
    being expanded to be on a larger register, which is not a valid transformation.  Now, a
    condition on a single bit or a register will be composed to be on precisely the bits as defined
    by the ``clbits`` argument.  A new aliasing register will be added to the base circuit to
    facilitate this, if necessary.  Fixed `#6583 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/8691>__`.
