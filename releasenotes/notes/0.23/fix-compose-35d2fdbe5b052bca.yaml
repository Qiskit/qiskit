    Fixed an issue with the :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.compose` method where it would
    incorrectly reject valid qubit or clbit specifiers. This has been fixed so
    that the method now accepts the same set of qubit and clbit
    specifiers as other :class:`.QuantumCircuit` methods, such as
    :meth:`~.QuantumCircuit.append`.
    Fixed `#8691 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/8691>`__.

    Fixed an issue with the :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.compose` method where it would
    incorrectly map registers in conditions on the given circuit to complete
    registers on the base.  Previously, the mapping was very imprecise; the bits
    used within each condition were not subject to the mapping, and instead an inaccurate attempt was
    made to find a corresponding register.  This could also result in a condition on a smaller register
    being expanded to be on a larger register, which is not a valid transformation. Now, a
    condition on a single bit or a register will be composed to be on precisely the bits as defined
    by the ``clbits`` argument. A new aliasing register will be added to the base circuit to
    facilitate this, if necessary. Fixed `#6583 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/6583>`__.
