    Added a new keyword argument, ``allow_unknown_parameters``, to the
    :meth:`.ParameterExpression.bind` and :meth:`.ParameterExpression.subs`
    methods. When set this new argument enables passing a dictionary
    containing unknown parameters to these methods without causing an error
    to be raised. Previously, this would always raise an error without
    any way to disable that behavior.
