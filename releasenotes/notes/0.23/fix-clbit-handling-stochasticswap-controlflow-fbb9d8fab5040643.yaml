    Fixed handling of classical bits in :class:`.StochasticSwap` with control flow.
    Previously, control-flow operations would be expanded to contain all the
    classical bits in the outer circuit and not contracted again, leading to a
    mismatch between the numbers of clbits the instruction reported needing and
    the actual number supplied to it.
