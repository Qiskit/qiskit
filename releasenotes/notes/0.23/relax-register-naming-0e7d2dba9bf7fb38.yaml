fixes:
  - |
    :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.qasm` will now correctly escape gate and register
    names that collide with reserved OpenQASM 2 keywords.  Fixes
    `#5043 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/5043>`__.
upgrade:
  - |
    The names of :class:`.Register` instances (which includes instances of
    :class:`~.QuantumRegister` and :class:`~.ClassicalRegigster`) are no longer constrained to be
    valid OpenQASM 2 identifiers.  This is being done as the restriction is
    overly strict as Qiskit becomes more decoupled from OpenQASM 2, and even the
    OpenQASM 3 specification is not so restrictive.  If you were relying on
    registers having valid OpenQASM 2 identifier names, you will need to begin
    escaping the names.  A simplistic version of this could be done, for example,
    by::

      import re
      import string

      def escape(name: str) -> str:
        out = re.sub(r"\W", "_", name, flags=re.ASCII)
        if not out or out[0] not in string.ascii_lowercase:
          return "reg_" + out
        return out
deprecations:
  - |
    The method :meth:`.Register.qasm` is deprecated and will be removed in a
    future release.  This method is found on the subclasses :class:`.QuantumRegister`
    and :class:`.ClassicalRegister`.  The deprecation is because the
    :meth:`~.Register.qasm` method promotes a false view of the responsible
    party for safe conversion to OpenQASM 2; a single object alone does not
    have the context to provide a safe conversion, such as whether its name
    clashes after escaping it to produce a valid identifier.
  - |
    The class-variable regular expression :attr:`.Register.name_format` is
    deprecated and wil be removed in a future release.  The names of registers
    are now permitted to be any valid Python string, so the regular expression
    has no use any longer.
