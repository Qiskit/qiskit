  Qiskit Terra 0.23.0 is a major feature release that includes
  a multitude of new features and bugfixes. The highlights for this release
  are:

    * Support for importing `OpenQASM3` programs and creating :class:`.QuantumCircuit` objects
      from the input program via two new functions :func:`qiskit.qasm3.load` and
      :func:`qiskit.qasm3.loads`.

    * Improvements to the library of synthesis algorithms included in
      Qiskit. This includes the following new synthesis functions:

        * Clifford Synthesis

          * :func:`~.synth_clifford_layers`
          * :func:`~.synth_clifford_greedy`

        * Linear Function Synthesis:

          * :func:`~.synth_cnot_depth_line_kms`
          * :func:`~.synth_cnot_count_full_pmh`

        * Permutation Synthesis:

          * :func:`~.synth_permutation_basic`
          * :func:`~.synth_permutation_acg`
          * :func:`~.synth_permutation_depth_lnn_kms`

        * :class:`~.SolovayKitaevDecomposition` detailed in:
          https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0505030

        * New plugins for :class:`~.HighLevelSynthesis`:

          * :class:`~.ACGSynthesisPermutation`
          * :class:`~.KMSSynthesisPermutation`
          * :class:`~.BasicSynthesisPermutation`

        * New plugin for :class:`~.UnitarySynthesis`

          * :class:`~.SolovayKitaevSynthesis`

    * Performance improvements to :class:`~.SabreLayout`. The pass
      is now primarily written in Rust which can lead to a runtime
      improvement, however the bigger improvement is in the quality of
      the output (on average, fewer :class:`~.SwapGate` gates
      introduced by :class:`~.SabreSwap`). For example, running
      :class:`~.SabreLayout` and :class:`~.SabreSwap` on Bernstein
      Vazirani circuits targeting the :class:`~.FakeSherbrooke` backend
      yields the following results:

  This release also deprecates support for running with Python 3.7. A ``DeprecationWarning``
  will now be emitted if you run Qiskit with Python 3.7. Support for Python 3.7 will be removed
  as part of the 0.25.0 release (currently planned for release in July 2022), at which point
  you will need Python 3.8 or newer to use Qiskit.
