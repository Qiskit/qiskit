    Fixed an issue with the :class:`~.SabreSwap` pass which would cause the
    output of multiple runs of the pass without the ``seed`` argument specified
    to reuse the same random number generator seed between runs instead of
    using different seeds. This previously caused identical results to be
    returned between runs even when no ``seed`` was specified.
