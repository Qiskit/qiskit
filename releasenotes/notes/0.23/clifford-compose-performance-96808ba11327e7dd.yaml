features:
  - |
    The :class:`.Clifford` class now takes an optional ``copy`` keyword argument in its
    constructor.  If set to ``False``, then a :class:`.StabilizerTable` provided
    as input will not be copied, but will be used directly.  This can have
    performance benefits, if the data in the table will never be mutated by any
    other means.
  - |
    The performance of :meth:`.Clifford.compose` has been greatly improved for
    all numbers of qubits.  For operators of 20 qubits, the speedup is on the
    order of 100 times.
