deprecations:
  - |
    The legacy version of the pulse drawer present in the
    :mod:`qiskit.visualization.pulse` has been deprecated and will be
    removed in a future release. This includes the :class:`~.ScheduleDrawer`
    and :class`WaveformDrawer` classes. This module has been superseded
    by the :mod:`qiskit.visualization.pulse_v2` drawer and the typical user
    API :func:`.pulse_drawer` and :meth:`.PulseBlock.draw` are already updated
    internally to use :mod:`qiskit.visualization.pulse_v2`.
  - |
    The :meth:`.pulse.Instruction.draw` method has been deprecated and will
    removed in a future release. The need for this method has been superseded
    by the :mod:`qiskit.visualization.pulse_v2` drawer which doesn't require
    :class:`~.pulse.Instrucion` objects to have their own draw method. If
    you need to draw a pulse instruction you should leverage the
    :func:`.pulse_drawer` instead.
