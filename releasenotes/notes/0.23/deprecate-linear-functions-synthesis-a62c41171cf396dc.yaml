deprecations:
  - |
    The class :class:`~.LinearFunctionsSynthesis` class is now deprecated
    and will be removed in a future release. It has been superseded
    by the more general :class:`~.HighLevelSynthesis` class which should
    be used instead. For example, you can instantiate an instance of
    :class:`~.HighLevelSynthesis` that will behave the same way as
    :class:`~.LinearFunctionSynthesis` with::

        from qiskit.transpiler.passes import HighLevelSynthesis
        from qiskit.transpiler.passes.synthesis.high_level_synthesis import HLSConfig

        HighLevelSynthesis(
            HLSConfig(
                linear_function=[("default", {})],
                use_default_on_unspecified=False,
            )
        )
