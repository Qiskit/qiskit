    The circuit drawers (:meth:`.QuantumCircuit.draw` and :func:`.circuit_drawer`) will no
    longer emit a warning about the ``cregbundle`` parameter when using the default arguments,
    if the content of the circuit requires all bits to be drawn individually.  This was most
    likely to appear when trying to draw circuits with new-style control-flow operations.
