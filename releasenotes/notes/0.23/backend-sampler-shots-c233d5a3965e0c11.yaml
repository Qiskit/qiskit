fixes:

    The output from the :meth:`~.BackendSampler.run` method of the the
    :class:`~.BackendSampler` class now sets the
    ``shots`` and ``stddev_upper_bound`` attributes of the returned
    :class:`~.QuasiDistribution`. Previously these attributes were missing
    which prevent some post-processing using the output.
    Fixed `#9311 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/9311>`__
