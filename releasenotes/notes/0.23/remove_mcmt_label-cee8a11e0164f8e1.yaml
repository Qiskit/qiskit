upgrade:
  - |
    The previously deprecated ``label`` argument for the constructor of the
    :class:`~.MCMT` and :class:`~.MCMTVChain` classes has been removed.
    It was deprecated as of the Qiskit Terra 0.19.0 release (Decemeber, 2021).
    Using the ``label`` argument on these classes was undefined behavior
    as they are subclasses of :class:`~.QuantumCircuit` instead of
    :class:`~.circuit.Instruction`. This would result in the assigned label generally
    being ignored. If you need to assign a ``label`` to an
    instance of :class:`~.MCMT` or :class:`~.MCMTVChain` you should convert
    them to an :class:`~.Gate` instance with :meth:`~.QuantumCircuit.to_gate`
    and then assign the desired label to :attr:`~.Gate.label` attribute. For
    example::

        from qiskit.circuit.library import MCMT, XGate

        mcmt_circuit = MCMT(XGate(), 3, 2)
        mcmt_gate = mcmt_circuit.to_gate()
        mcmt_gate.label = "Custom MCMT X"
