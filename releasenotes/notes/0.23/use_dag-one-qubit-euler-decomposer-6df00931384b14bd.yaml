    Added a new keyword argument, ``use_dag`` to the constructor for the
    :class:`~.OneQubitEulerDecomposer` class. When ``use_dag`` is set to
    ``True`` the output from the decomposer will be a :class:`~.DAGCircuit`
    object instead of :class:`~.QuantumCircuit` object. This is useful
    for transpiler passes that use :class:`~.OneQubitEulerDecomposer` (such
    as :class:`~.Optimize1qGatesDecomposition`) as working directly with
    a :class:`~.DAGCircuit` avoids the overhead of converting between
    :class:`~.QuantumCircuit` and :class:`~.DAGCircuit`.
