    Fixed a performance bug where the new primitive-based variational algorithms
    :class:`.minimum_eigensolvers.VQE`, :class:`.eigensolvers.VQD` and :class:`.SamplingVQE`
    did not batch energy evaluations per default, which resulted in a significant slowdown
    if a hardware backend was used.
