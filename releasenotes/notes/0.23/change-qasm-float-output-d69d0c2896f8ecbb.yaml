    The OpenQASM 2 exporter (:meth:`.QuantumCircuit.qasm`) will now emit higher
    precision floating point numbers for gate parameters per default. This is
    accomplished by relying on Python's built-in float formatting in case no
    suitable approximation to some power/fraction of `pi` can be found.

    In addition, a tighter bound (`1e-12` instead of `1e-6`) is used for checking
    whether a given parameter is close to a fraction/power of `pi`.

    Fixed `#7166 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/7166>`__.
