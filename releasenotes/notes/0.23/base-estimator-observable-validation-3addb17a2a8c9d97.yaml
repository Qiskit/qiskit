    The :meth:`.BaseEstimator.run` method's ``observables`` argument now
    accepts a ``str`` or sequence of ``str`` input type in addition to the
    other types already accepted. When used the input string format
    should match the Pauli string representation accepted by the constructor
    for :class:`~.quantum_info.Pauli` objects.
