upgrade:
  - |
    Fully normalize ``observables`` arg in ``BaseEstimator.run()`` method to the more 
    specific type ``tuple[SparsePauliOp, ...]``.
  - |
    Additionally, through this new normalization ``str`` types are now accepted both 
    standalone, or as elements in a ``Sequence`` object.
