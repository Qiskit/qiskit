    ``tweedledum`` has been removed as a core requirement of Qiskit Terra.  The
    functionality provided (:mod:`qiskit.circuit.classicalfunction`) is still
    available, if ``tweedledum`` is installed manually, such as by:

      .. code-block:: text

      pip install tweedledum

    This change was made because ``tweedledum`` development has slowed to the
    point of not keeping up with new Python and OS releases, and was blocking
    some Qiskit users from installing Qiskit.
