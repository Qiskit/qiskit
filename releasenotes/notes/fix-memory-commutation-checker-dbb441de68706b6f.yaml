    Fixed an issue with the :class:`~.CommutationChecker` class where it would
    attempt to internally allocate an array for :math:`2^{n}` qubits when it
    only needed an array to represent :math:`n` qubits. This could cause
    an excessive amount of memory for wide gates, for example a 4 qubit
    gate would require 32 gigabytes instead of 2 kilobytes.
    Fixed `#9197 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/9197>`__
