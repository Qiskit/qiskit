    Fixes issue where binding to circuits in 'execute' would cause all
    the bound circuits to get the same circuit name, which meant the
    result names were also not unique. This fix causes
    `bind_parameters` and `assign_parameters` to assign a unique
    circuit name when `inplace=False` as:

       <base name>-<class instance no.>[-<pid name>]

    where <base name> is the name supplied by the "name" keyword,
    otherwise it defaults to "circuit". The class instance number gets
    incremented every time an instance of the class is generated. <pid
    name> is appended if called outside the main process in non-win32
    systems.
