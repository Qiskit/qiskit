    Fixed a bug that caused library functions that call :meth:`n_local`, such as :meth:`efficient_su2`
    to error out when passed a num_qubits argument that equals 1. The default entanglement blocks for these
    methods was being set to "cx", but now if num_qubits <= 1, then entanglements_blocks will equal an empty array.
