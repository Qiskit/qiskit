    Fixed a bug that caused the following circuit library functions to produce errors
    when called with ``num_qubits=1``: :func:`.efficient_su2`, :func:`.real_amplitudes`,
    :func:`.excitation_preserving` and :func:`.pauli_two_design` (for a single qubit,
    these circuits do not contain any 2-qubit gates).
    Fixed `#13480 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/13480>`__.
