    This change fixes a bug in PauliSumOp where permute would raise the error
    QiskitError: 'Pauli string label "" is not valid.' if the permutation had
    the same number of pauli terms. Calling permute([2, 1, 0]) on X ^ Y ^ Z
    no longer raises an error with this fix and now returns Z ^ Y ^ X.
