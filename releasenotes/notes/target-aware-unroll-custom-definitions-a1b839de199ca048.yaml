    The :class:`~.UnrollCustomDefinitions` transpiler pass has a new keyword
    argument, ``target``, on it's constructor. This argument can be used to
    specify a :class:`~.Target` object that represnts the compilation target.
    If used it superscedes the ``basis_gates`` argument to determine if an
    instruction in the circuit is present on the target backend.
