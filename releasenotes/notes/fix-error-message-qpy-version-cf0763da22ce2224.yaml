    Fixed an issue with :func:`.qpy.load` when attempting to load a QPY format
    version that is not supported by this version of Qiskit it will now display
    a descriptive error message. Previously, it would raise an internal error
    because of the incompatibility between the formats which was difficult to
    debug. If the QPY format version is not supported that indicates the Qiskit
    version will need to be upgraded to read the QPY payload.
