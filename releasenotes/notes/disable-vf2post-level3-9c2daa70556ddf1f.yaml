    In Qiskit 2.2.0 the :class:`.VF2PostLayout` transpiler pass was added to
    the ``optimization`` stage of the preset pass manager when
    ``optimization_level=3``. However, the output of the pass was not ever
    applied to the circuit. This release removes the pass from the preset pass
    manager's ``optimization`` stage to save the runtime cost. In Qiskit 2.2.0
    the pass will be part of the ``optimization`` stage and the output will
    be applied if the pass finds a better layout.
