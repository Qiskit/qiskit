    Implementations of the multi-controlled X Gate (``MCXGrayCode``,
    ``MCXRecursive`` and ``MCXVChain``) have had their ``name``
    properties changed to more accurately describe their
    implementation (``mcx_gray``, ``mcx_recursive``, and
    ``mcx_vchain`` respectively.) Previously, these gates shared the
    name ``mcx` with ``MCXGate``, which caused these gates to be
    incorrectly transpiled and simulated.
