deprecations:
  - |
    The :class:`~qiskit.quantum_info.PauliTable` is deprecated and will be removed in a future
    release. Instead, the :class:`~qiskit.quantum_info.PauliList` should be used.
    With this change, :meth:`~qiskit.quantum_info.StabilizerTable.pauli` has been deprecated
    so that you should operate directly from :meth:`~qiskit.quantum_info.StabilizerTable.array`
    without it.
