    Qiskit 0.45.3 is a point release with no code changes other than to raise an :exc:`ImportError`
    if it detects it has been installed in an invalid environment with Qiskit 1.0+.

    Please read `our migration guide about the new packaging <https://qisk.it/1-0-packaging-migration>`__
    for help on errors, preparing for Qiskit 1.0, and more detailed background information.

    The packaging structure of Qiskit is changing in Qiskit 1.0, and unfortunately the changed
    requirements cannot be fully communicated to ``pip``, especially if ``pip install --upgrade``
    commands are run after the environment has been initially configured.  All versions of Qiskit
    prior to 1.0 (including this one) have an installation conflict with Qiskit 1.0 that ``pip``
    will not resolve.

    If ``import qiskit`` raises an :exc:`ImportError` for you, your environment is in an invalid
    state, and versions of Qiskit 0.45/0.46 and 1.0 are both reachable, which will result in subtley
    broken code.  You will need to create a new virtual environment, and ensure that *only* one of
    the two versions are installed.  In particular, if you are intending to install Qiskit 1.0,
    you must have no packages that depend on ``qiskit-terra`` installed; these packages are
    incompatible with Qiskit 1.0 and must be updated.  If you are intending to install Qiskit 0.45
    or 0.46, you must ensure that you have nothing attempting to install ``qiskit>=1.0``.

    If you develop a library based on Qiskit and you still have a dependency on ``qiskit-terra``,
    you should urgently release a new package that depends only on ``qiskit``.  Since version 0.44,
    the ``qiskit`` package contained only the ``qiskit-terra`` compiler core (the component that is
    now simply called "Qiskit"), so if your minimum version is ``0.44``, you can safely switch a
    ``qiskit-terra>=0.44`` dependency to ``qiskit>=0.44`` with no change in what will be installed.
    For more detail and recommendations for testing and preparation, see the
    `section for developers of the migration guide <https://qisk.it/1-0-packaging-migration#for-developers>`__.
