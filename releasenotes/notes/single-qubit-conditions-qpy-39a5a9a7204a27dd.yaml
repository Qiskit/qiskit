    Fixed the generation and loading of QPY files with
    :func:`qiskit.circuit.qpy_serialization.dump` and
    :func:`qiskit.circuit.qpy_serialization.load` for
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit` objects that contain instructions
    with classical conditions on a single :class:`~qiskit.circuit.Clbit` instead
    of a :class:`~qiskit.circuit.ClassicalRegister`. While the use of single
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.Clbit` conditions is not yet fully supported, if you
    were using them in a circuit they are now correctly serialized by QPY.
