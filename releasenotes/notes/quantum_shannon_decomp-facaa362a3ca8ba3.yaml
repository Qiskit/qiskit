features:
  - |
    Added a new module to apply Quantum Shannon Decomposition of
    arbitrary unitaries. This functionality replaces the previous
    usage of the isometry module in the unitary synthesis transpiler
    pass as well as when adding unitaries to a circuit using a
    UnitaryGate.
upgrade:
  - |
    The Quantum Shannon Decomposition uses about half the cnot gates as the
    isometry implementation when decomposing unitary matrices of greater than
    two qubits.
