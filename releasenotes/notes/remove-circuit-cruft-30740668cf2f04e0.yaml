    The :class:`.QuantumCircuit` methods:

    * ``cast``
    * ``cbit_argument_conversion``
    * ``cls_instances``
    * ``cls_prefix``
    * ``qbit_argument_conversion``

    have been removed, following their deprecation in Qiskit 1.2.  These methods were internal
    helper functions, and never intended to be public API.  No replacement is provided.
