    Introduced a new transpiler pass capable of generating calibrations
    and adding them to a quantum circuit. The
    :py:class:`~qiskit.transpiler.passes.RZXCalibrationBuilder` takes calibrated
    CNOT gates and creates the
    calibrations for RZXGates with an arbitrary rotation angle. The schedules
    are created by stretching and compressing the GaussianSquare pulses of the
    echoed-cross resonance gates. Furthermore, we added templates so that users
    can leverage the template matching to automatically find and replace gate
    sequences, such as CNOT - P(theta) - CNOT, with more efficent circuits
    based on RZXGates with a calibration.
