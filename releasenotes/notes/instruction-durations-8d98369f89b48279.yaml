    The `InstructionDurations` class is upgraded to accept gate parameters. Now,
    an instruction duration is a tuple of `(inst_name, qubits, duration, parameters, unit)`.
    This makes it possible to run transpiler passes such as Dynamical Decoupling
    on circuits that have pulse gates with parameters such as

    .. parsed-literal::

      circ = QuantumCircuit(2)
      circ.x(0)
      circ.cx(0, 1)
      circ.rx(1.5, 1)

      with pulse.build() as rx:
          pulse.play(pulse.Gaussian(2000, 0.1, 500), pulse.DriveChannel(1))

      circ.add_calibration("rx", (1, ), rx, params = [1.5])
