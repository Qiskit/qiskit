features:
  - |
    Added methods --
    :mod:`qiskit.providers.models.PulseBackendConfiguration.get_channel_qubits(channel)`
    to get a list of all qubits operated by the given channel and
    :mod:`qiskit.providers.models.PulseBackendConfiguration.get_qubit_channel(qubits)`
    to get a list of channels operating on the given qubit.

deprecations:
  - |
    Previously, ``control(channel)`` returned ``ControlChannel(channel)``. This logic
    was not accurate (Issue `#3311 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/3311>`__).
    The parameter ``channel`` has been deprecated. ControlChannel(index) is now generated from
    the backend configuration ``channels`` which has the information of all channels and the
    qubits they operate on. Now, the method
    :mod:`qiskit.providers.models.PulseBackendConfiguration.control` takes the parameter --
    ``qubits`` of the form **(control_qubit, target_qubit)**  and type **list or tuple**,
    and returns a list of control channel(s).
