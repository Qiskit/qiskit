    The :class:`.Split2QUnitaries` transpiler pass has been upgraded to
    handle the case where the unitary in consideration can be written
    as a SWAP gate and two 1-qubit gates. In this case, it splits the
    unitary and also applies virtual swapping similar to what is done in
    :class:`.ElidePermutations`. This functionality can be controlled with a new argument,
    ``split_swap``, on the constructor of :class`.Split2QUnitaries` which can be used to disable
    splitting swap equivalent gates.
