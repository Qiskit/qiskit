    Added a ``max_job_tries`` parameter to :obj:`~qiskit.utils.QuantumInstance`,
    to limit the number of times a job will attempt to be executed on a backend.
    Previously the submission and fetching of results would be attempted
    infinitely, even if the job was cancelled or errored on the backend.  The
    default is now 50, and the previous behaviour can be achieved by setting
    ``max_job_tries=-1``.  Fixes `#6872
    <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/6872>`__ and `#6821
    <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/6821>`__.
