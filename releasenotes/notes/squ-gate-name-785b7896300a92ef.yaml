    The :class:`~qiskit.transpiler.passes.UnitarySynthesis` transpiler pass in
    :mod:`qiskit.transpiler.passes` has a new kwarg in the constructor,
    ``min_qubits``. When specified this can be set to an ``int`` value which
    is the minimum size :class:`~qiskit.extensions.UnitaryGate` object to
    run the unitary synthesis on. If a :class:`~qiskit.extensions.UnitaryGate`
    in a :class:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit` uses fewer qubits it will
    be skipped by that instance of the pass.
upgrade:
  - |
    The :attr:`~qiskit.extensions.SingleQubitUnitary.name` attribute of the
    :class:`~qiskit.extensions.SingleQubitUnitary` gate class has been changed
    from ``unitary`` to ``squ``. This was necessary to avoid a conflict with
    the :class:`~qiskit.extensions.UnitaryGate` class's name which was also
    ``unitary`` since the 2 gates are not the same and don't have the same
    implementation (and can't be used interchangeably).
