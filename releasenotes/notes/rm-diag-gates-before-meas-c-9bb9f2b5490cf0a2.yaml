    Added a new standalone transpiler pass function
    ``qk_transpiler_passes_remove_diagonal_gates_before_measure_circuit`` which is for running the
    :class:`.RemoveDiagonalGatesBeforeMeasure` transpiler pass. Calling this function in C is equivalent
    to running the pass in Python like::
      
      RemoveDiagonalGatesBeforeMeasure(..)(circuit)
