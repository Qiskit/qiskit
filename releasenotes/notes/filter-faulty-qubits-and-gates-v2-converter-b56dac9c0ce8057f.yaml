    The :class:`~.BackendV2Converter` class has a new keyword argument,
    ``filter_faulty``, on its constructor. When this argument is set to ``True``
    the converter class will filter out any qubits or operations listed
    as non-operational in the :class:`~.BackendProperties` payload for the
    input :class:`~.BackendV1`. While not extensively used a
    :class:`~.BackendProperties` object supports annotating both qubits
    and gates as being non-operational. Previously, if a backend had set that
    flag on any qubits or gates the output :class:`BackendV2` instance and
    its :class:`~.Target` would include all operations whether they were
    listed as operational or not. By leveraging the new flag you can filter
    out these non-operational qubits and gates from the :class:`~.Target`.
    When the flag is set the output backend will still be listed as the full
    width (e.g. a 24 qubit backend with 4 qubits listed as not operational will
    still show it has 24 qubits) but the faulty qubits will not have any
    operations listed as being supported in the :class:`~.Target`.
