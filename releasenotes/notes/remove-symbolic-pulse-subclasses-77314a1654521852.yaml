upgrade:
  - |
    Symbolic pulse subclasses :class:`.Gaussian`, :class:`.GaussianSquare`,
    :class:`.Drag` and :class:`.Constant` have been upgraded to
    instantiate :class:`SymbolicPulse` rather than the subclass itself.
    All parametric pulse object in pulse programs must be symbolic pulse instance,
    because subclassing is no longer neccesary. Note that :class:`SymbolicPulse` can
    uniquely identify a particular envelope with the symbolic expression object
    defined in :attr:`SymbolicPulse.envelope`.
  - |
    `isinstance` check with pulse classes :class:`.Gaussian`, :class:`.GaussianSquare`,
    :class:`.Drag` and :class:`.Constant` has been invalidated because
    these classes are never instantiated.
    Instead of using type information, :attr:`SymbolicPulse.pulse_type` must be used.
