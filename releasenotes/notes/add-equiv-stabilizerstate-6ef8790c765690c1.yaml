    Add an `equiv` method to the :class:`qiskit.quantum_info.StabilizerState` class,
    that checks if the generating sets of two stabilizer states generate the same stabilizer group.
    For example, the stabilizer group of the two-qubit Bell state contains the four elements
    {II, XX, -YY, ZZ} and hence can be generated by either [XX, ZZ] or [XX, -YY] or [-YY, ZZ].
