prelude: |
    This release includes 2 new classes,
    :class:`~qiskit.result.ProbDistribution` and
    :class:`~qiskit.result.QuasiDistribution`, which were needed for
    compatibility with the recent qiskit-ibmq-provider release's beta support
    for the
    `qiskit-runtime <https://github.com/Qiskit-Partners/qiskit-runtime>`__.
    These were only added for compatibility with that new feature in the
    qiskit-ibmq-provider release and the API for these classes is considered
    experimental and not considered stable for the 0.17.x release series. The
    interface may change when 0.1.8.0 is released in the future.
