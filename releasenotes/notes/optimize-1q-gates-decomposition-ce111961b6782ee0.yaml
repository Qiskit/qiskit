features_transpiler:
  - |
    Added a new method :meth:`.DAGCircuit.control_flow_ops` which provides a fast
    path to get all the :class:`.DAGOpNode` in a :class:`.DAGCircuit` that
    contain a :class:`.ControlFlowOp`. This was possible before using the
    :meth:`.DAGCircuit.op_nodes` method and passing the :class:`.ControlFlowOp` class
    as a filter, but this new function will perform the operation faster.
  - |
    Ported the entirety of the :class:`.Optimize1qGatesDecomposition` transpiler
    pass to Rust. This improves the runtime performance of the pass between 5x
    to 10x.
