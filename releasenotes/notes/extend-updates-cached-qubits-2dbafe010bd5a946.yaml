    Extending circuits with differing registers updated the ``qregs`` and 
    ``cregs`` properties accordingly, but not the ``qubits`` and ``clbits`` 
    lists. As these are no longer generated from the registers but are cached
    lists, this lead to a discrepancy of registers and bits. This has been 
    fixed and the ``extend`` method explicitly updates the cached bit lists.
