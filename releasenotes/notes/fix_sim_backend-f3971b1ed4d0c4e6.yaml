fixes:
  - |
    Fix `backend_utils.py` for simulator backends with BackendV2.
    `is_simulator_backend` and `is_local_backend` returns `True`
    if backend name that contains `simulator`.

    In `test/python/providers/test_fake_backends.py`, ignore running test
    when backend is V2.

    In `test/python/pulse/test_block.py` test case is removed because
    Aer does not have pulse simulator anymore.
