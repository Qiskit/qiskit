    Fixed an incorrect caching behavior during parameter assignment that
    could result in definitions within the :class:`~.EquivalenceLibrary`
    becoming corrupted. This resolves unexpected issues when running
    basis translation in parallel. Fixed `#13504 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/13504>`__.
