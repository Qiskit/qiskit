    Fix incorrect behavior in :class:`.CircuitData` in which, upon parameter assignment,
    we attempted to modify the cached operation inside of a ``PackedInstruction``. Now
    we instead discard said cache prompting the ``PackedInstruction`` to build a new Python
    operation should it be needed.
