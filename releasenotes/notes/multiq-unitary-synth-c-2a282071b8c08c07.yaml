    The :c:func:`qk_transpiler_pass_standalone_unitary_synthesis` and
    :c:func:`qk_transpile` now support synthesizing 3+ qubit
    :class:`.UnitaryGate` objects in a circuit. In Qiskit 2.2 this was not
    supported as the underlying synthesis algorithm :func:`.qs_decomposition`
    used for 3+ qubit unitary synthesis was previously written in Python, but
    now that it has been ported to Rust this functionality is now available
    from C.
