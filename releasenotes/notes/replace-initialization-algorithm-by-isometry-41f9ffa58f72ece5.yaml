    Replacing the internal synthesis algorithm of :class:`~.library.StatePreparation`
    and :class:`~.library.Initialize` of Shende et al. by the algorithm given in
    :class:`~.library.Isometry` of Iten et al.
    The new algorithm reduces the number of CX gates and the circuit depth by a factor of 2.
