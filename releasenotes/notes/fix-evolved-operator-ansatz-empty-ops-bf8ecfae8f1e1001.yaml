fixes:
  - |
    The :class:`.EvolvedOperatorAnsatz` now correctly handles the case where the
    ``operators`` argument is an empty list. Previously, this would result in an
    error.
  - |
    Fixed a consistency issue with :class:`.EvolvedOperatorAnsatz` instances with
    zero qubits. Previously, such instances would contain a single :class:`.QuantumRegister`
    in :attr:`~.EvolvedOperatorAnsatz.qregs` with zero qubits, but now no registers
    are created. This behavior aligns more consistently with its superclass 
    :class:`.QuantumCircuit`.
