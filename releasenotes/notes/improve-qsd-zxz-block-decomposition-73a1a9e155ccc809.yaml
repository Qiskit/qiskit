    Improve the :func:`.qs_decomposition` function which was originally based on
    Shende et. al. (https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0406176).
    The new synthesis method is based on Krol and Al-Ars (https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13692),
    and reduce the total number of :class:`.CXGate`\ s of a general n-qubit unitary by
    (4 ** (n − 2) − 1) / 3 :class:`.CXGate`\ s.
    With the improved decomposition, a general 3-qubit unitary can be decomposed using 19
    :class:`.CXGate`\ s (rather than 20).

    The default values of the parameters `opt_a1` and `opt_a2` of :func:`.qs_decomposition`
    are now ``opt_a1 = None`` and ``opt_a2 = None``.
    When ``opt_a2 = None`` we choose the optimal value ``opt_a2 = False`` if the unitary is
    controlled and ``opt_a2 = True`` if it is not controlled.
    When ``opt_a1 = None`` we choose the optimal value ``opt_a1 = True``.
