    Improve the :func:`.qs_decomposition` function which was originally based on
    Shende et. al. (https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0406176).
    The new synthesis method is based on Krol and Al-Ars (https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13692),
    and reduce the total number of :class:`.CXGate`\ s of a general n-qubit unitary by
    (4 ** (n − 2) − 1) / 3 :class:`.CXGate`\ s.
    With the improved decomposition, a general 3-qubit unitary can be decomposed using 19
    :class:`.CXGate`\ s (rather than 20).

    The default values of the arguments ``opt_a1`` and ``opt_a2`` of :func:`.qs_decomposition`
    are now ``opt_a1 = None`` and ``opt_a2 = None``. The new defaults will choose the
    optimal value based on whether the input unitary for the ``mat`` argument is controlled
    or not to result in the minimal :class:`.CXGate` count by default. If you require the previous
    behavior you can explicitly call ``opt_a1 = True`` and ``opt_a2 = True`` to maintain the same
    behavior as previous releases.
