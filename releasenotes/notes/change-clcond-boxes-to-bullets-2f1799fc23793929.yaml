    Fixes the inconsistency in drawing classical control when cregbundle=False
    in the text drawer. When ``cregbundle=False``, the text drawer now draws the
    classical control as bullets which is consistent with the other drawers.
    See `#6290 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/6290>`__ for
    more information.

    Fixes the incorrect ordering of classical condition bullets when ``cregbundle``
    is set to ``False`` and ``reverse_bits`` is set to ``True``.
