    Fixes the inconsistency in drawing classical control when cregbundle=False
    in the text drawer. When cregbundle=False, the text drawer now draws the
    classical control as bullets which is consistent with the other drawers.
    See `#6290 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/6290>`__ for
    more information.
