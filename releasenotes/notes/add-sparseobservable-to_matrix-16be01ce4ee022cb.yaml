    The high-performance, Rust-accelerated :meth:~.SparseObservable.to_matrix logic has been
    migrated from :class:.SparsePauliOp to :class:.SparseObservable, enabling efficient matrix
    conversion for observables defined with projectors (the extended Pauli alphabet). The
    :meth:~.SparsePauliOp.to_matrix method now uses this new, more general implementation.
