    The performance of the method :meth:`quantum_info.QuantumState.sample_counts`
    has been improved from O(n) to O(1). Before, we sampled n shots from the
    state and then counted the number of shots for each basis state. Now, we
    instead sample directly from the distribution of the number of shots for
    each basis state.
