    Fixed label generation for :class:`~.PauliEvolutionGate` with 
    :class:`~.SparseObservable` operators. Labels now display Pauli operators 
    with qubit indices (e.g., "X0 X1") instead of the concatenated string format 
    (e.g., "XXII"), improving clarity when distinguishing between different operators.
