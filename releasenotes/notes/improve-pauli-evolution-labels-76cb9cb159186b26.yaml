    Fixed label generation for :class:`.PauliEvolutionGate` with 
    :class:`.SparseObservable` operators. Labels now display Pauli operators 
    with qubit indices (e.g., "X0 X2") instead of the concatenated string format 
    (e.g., "XX"), improving clarity when distinguishing between different operators.
