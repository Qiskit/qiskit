features:
  - |
    The methods on the :class:`qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit` class for adding
    gates (for example :meth:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.h`) which were
    previously added dynamically at run time to the class definition have been
    refactored to be statically defined methods of the class. This means that
    static analyzer (such as IDEs) can now read these methods.
deprecations:
  - |
    The ``qiskit.extensions.standard`` module is deprecated and will be
    removed in a future release. The gate classes in that module have been
    moved to :mod:`qiskit.circuit.library.standard_gates`.
