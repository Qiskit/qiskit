    The :class:`qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit` methods
    :meth:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.inverse`,
    :meth:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.mirror` methods, as well as
    the ``QuantumCircuit.data`` setter would generate an invalid circuit when
    used on a parameterized circuit instance. This has been resolved and
    these methods should now work with a parameterized circuit. Fixes
    `#4235 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/4235>`_
