    Previously when creating a controlled version of a standard qiskit
    gate if a ``ctrl_state`` was specified a generic ``ControlledGate``
    object would be returned whereas without it a standard qiskit
    controlled gate would be returned if it was defined. This PR
    allows standard qiskit controlled gates to understand
    ``ctrl_state``.

    Additionally, this PR fixes what might be considered a bug where
    setting the ``ctrl_state`` of an already controlled gate would
    assume the specified state applied to the full control width
    instead of the control qubits being added. For instance,::

      circ = QuantumCircuit(2)
      circ.h(0)
      circ.x(1)
      gate = circ.to_gate()
      cgate = gate.control(1)
      c3gate = cgate.control(2, ctrl_state=0)

    would apply ``ctrl_state`` to all three control qubits instead of just
    the two control qubits being added.
