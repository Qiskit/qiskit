    The :class:`qiskit.circuit.Instruction` method
    :meth:`qiskit.circuit.Instruction.is_parameterized` method had previously
    returned ``True`` for any ``Instruction`` instance which had a
    :class:`qiskit.circuit.Parameter` in any element of its ``params`` array,
    even if that ``Parameter`` had been fully bound. This has been corrected so
    that ``.is_parameterized`` will return ``False`` when the instruction is
    fully bound.
