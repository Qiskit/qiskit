features:
  - |
    The ``last_update_date`` parameter for
    :class:`~qiskit.providers.models.BackendProperties` can now also be
    passed in as a ``datetime`` object. Previously only a string in
    ISO8601 format was accepted.
upgrade:
  - |
    A new package,
    `python-dateutil <https://pypi.org/project/python-dateutil/>`_, is now
    required and has been added to the requirements list. It is being used
    to parse datetime strings received from external providers in
    :class:`~qiskit.providers.models.BackendProperties` objects.
