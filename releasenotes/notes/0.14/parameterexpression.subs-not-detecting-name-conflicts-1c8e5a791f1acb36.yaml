    :meth:`qiskit.circuit.ParameterExpression.subs` had not correctly detected
    some cases where substituting parameters would result in a two distinct
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.Parameters` objects in an expression with the same
    name. This has been corrected so a ``CircuitError`` will be raised in these
    cases.
