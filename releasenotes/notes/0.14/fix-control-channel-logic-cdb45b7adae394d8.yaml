features:
  - |
    Two new methods have been added to the
    :class:`qiskit.providers.models.PulseBackendConfiguration` for
    interacting with channels.

    * :meth:`~qiskit.providers.models.PulseBackendConfiguration.get_channel_qubits`
      to get a list of all qubits operated by the given channel and
    * :meth:`~qiskit.providers.models.PulseBackendConfiguration.get_qubit_channel`
      to get a list of channels operating on the given qubit.

deprecations:
  - |
    Passing a :class:`qiskit.pulse.ControlChannel` object in via the
    parameter ``channel`` for the
    :class:`qiskit.providers.models.PulseBackendConfiguration` method
    :meth:`~qiskit.providers.models.PulseBackendConfiguration.control` has been
    deprecated and will be removed in a future release. The
    ``ControlChannel`` objects are now generated from the backend configuration
    ``channels`` attribute which has the information of all channels and the
    qubits they operate on. Now, the method
    :meth:`~qiskit.providers.models.PulseBackendConfiguration.control`
    is expected to take the parameter ``qubits`` of the form
    ``(control_qubit, target_qubit)`` and type ``list``
    or ``tuple``, and returns a list of control channels.
