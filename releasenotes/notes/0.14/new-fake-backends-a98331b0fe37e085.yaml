    New fake backends are added under :mod:`qiskit.test.mock`. These include
    mocked versions of ``ibmq_armonk``, ``ibmq_essex``, ``ibmq_london``,
    ``ibmq_valencia``, ``ibmq_cambridge``, ``ibmq_paris``, ``ibmq_rome``, and
    ``ibmq_athens``. As with other fake backends, these include snapshots of
    calibration data (i.e. ``backend.defaults()``) and error data (i.e.
    ``backend.properties()``) taken from the real system, and can be used for
    local testing, compilation and simulation.
