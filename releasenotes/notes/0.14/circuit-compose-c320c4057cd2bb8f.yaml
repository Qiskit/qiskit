features:
  - |
    A new :meth:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.compose` method has been added
    to :class:`qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit`. It allows
    composition of two quantum circuits without having to turn one into
    a gate or instruction. It also allows permutations of qubits/clbits
    at the point of composition, as well as optional inplace modification.
    It can also be used in place of
    :meth:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.append()`, as it allows
    composing instructions and operators onto the circuit as well.
deprecations:
  - |
    The :meth:`qiskit.dagcircuit.DAGCircuit.compose` method now takes a list
    of qubits/clbits that specify the positional order of bits to compose onto.
    The dictionary-based method of mapping using the ``edge_map`` argument is
    deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
