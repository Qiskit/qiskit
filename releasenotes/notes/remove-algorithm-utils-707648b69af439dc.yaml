upgrade:
  - |
    The following algorithm utilities in :mod:`qiskit.utils` have been removed
    from the codebase:

    * ``algorithm_globals``
    * ``qiskit.utils.validation``

    They were deprecated in Qiskit 0.45 as a consequence of the migration
    of ``qiskit.algorithms`` to a standalone
    `package <https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-algorithms>`_, where
    these utils have also been migrated. The can be found in the new package
    under ``qiskit_algorithms.utils``.
