    Fixed a bug when :attr:`.SparsePauliOp.paulis` is set to be a :class:`.PauliList` with nonzero 
    phase, where subsequent calls to several :class:`.SparsePauliOp` methods would produce 
    incorrect results. Now when :attr:`.SparsePauliOp.paulis` is set to a :class:`.PauliList` with 
    nonzero phase, the phase is absorbed into :attr:`.SparsePauliOp.coeffs`, the phase of the 
    input :class:`.PauliList` is set to zero, and a warning is raised that the input 
    :class:`.PauliList` has been modified.
