    Fixed a bug when SparsePauliOp.paulis is set to be a PauliList with nonzero phase, where 
    subsequent calls to several SparsePauliOp methods would produce incorrect results. Now when 
    SparsePauliOp.paulis is set to a PauliList with nonzero phase, the phase is absorbed into 
    SparsePauliOp.coeffs, the phase of the input PauliList is set to zero, and a warning is 
    raised that the input PauliList has been modified.
