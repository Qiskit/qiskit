    A framework for preparing Gibbs quantum states is introduced. A designed interface is
    implemented for the case of Gibbs state preparation using Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution.
    The builder class  constructs a default ansatz and initial parameters accepted by the algorithm.
    In case a custom ansatz and initial parameters are provided by the user, tools for validating
    their correctness are provided. The result of the algorithm is an instance of a
    :class:`~qiskit.algorithms.gibbs_state_preparation.gibbs_state` class provided in this
    contribution. It contains a final quantum state (a Gibbs state) and relevant metadata. A method
    for calculating gradients of Gibbs states is also implemented there.
