    Fixed a bug in :func:`qiskit.visualization.pulse_v2.interface.draw` that doesn't 
    draw pulse schedule when the draw function is called with a :class:`.BackendV2` argument.
    Because the V2 backend doesn't report hardware channel frequencies,
    the generated drawing will show 'no freq.' below each channel label.
