    Fixed a bug in :class:`.NLocal` and derivatives, occurring when ``flatten=True`` was set
    and standard gates backed by Rust were used. When binding parameters in-place to such a
    circuit, the new parameter values were not correctly propagated to the circuit instructions.

    The circuit could still be compiled and used as expected, however, inspecting the individual
    operations would still show the old parameter values. For example::

      from qiskit.circuit.library import EfficientSU2

      circuit = EfficientSU2(2, flatten=True)
      circuit.assign_parameters([1.25] * circuit.num_parameters, inplace=True)

      print(circuit.data[0].operation.params)  # would print Î¸[0] instead of 1.25

    Fixed `#13478 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/13478>`__.
