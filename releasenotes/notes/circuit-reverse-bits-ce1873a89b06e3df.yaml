features:
  - |
    A new method :meth:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.reverse_bits` has been
    added to reverse the order of bits in a circuit (both quantum and classical
    bits). This can be used to switch a circuit from little-endian to big-endian
    and vice-versa.
deprecations:
  - |
    :meth:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.mirror` has been deprecated in favor
    of :meth:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.reverse_ops` since mirroring could be
    confused with swapping the output qubits of the circuit. Instead this method
    only reverses the order of gates that are applied.
