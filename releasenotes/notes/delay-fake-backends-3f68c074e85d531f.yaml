    The :class:`~.BackendV2` based fake backends in
    the :mod:`qiskit.providers.fake_provider` module, such as
    ``FakeMontrealV2``, previously were missing the :class:`~qiskit.circuit.Delay` operation
    support from their :attr:`~.BackendV2.target` attribute. This prevented
    compiling some :class:`~.QuantumCircuit` objects that contained
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.Delay` instructions to these backends. This has been corrected
    by adding the :class:`~qiskit.circuit.Delay` to the :class:`~.Target` object for each
    fake backend to ensure that the compiler knows that :class:`~qiskit.circuit.Delay` is
    a valid operation on the fake backends.
