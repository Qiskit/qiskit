    Add the :class:`~qiskit.algorithms.optimizers.QNSPSA` optimizer routine to the optimizers,
    and support second-order SPSA in :class:`~qiskit.algorithms.optimizers.SPSA`.

    2-spsa is an extension of the ordinary SPSA algorithm that allows to estimate the Hessian
    alongside the gradient, which is used to precondition the gradient before the parameter
    update step. As a second-order method, this tries to improve convergence of SPSA.

    QN-SPSA is a generalization of 2-SPSA where we estimate the Quantum Fisher Information Matrix
    instead of the Hessian to obtain a stochastic estimate of the Quantum Natural Gradient.

    For examples on how to use these optimizers, see the docstrings of
    :class:`~qiskit.algorithms.optimizers.SPSA` and :class:`~qiskit.algorithms.optimizers.QNSPSA`.
