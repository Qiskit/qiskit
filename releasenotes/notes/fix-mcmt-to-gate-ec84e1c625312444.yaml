    Fixed a bug where any instruction named ``"mcmt"`` was incorrectly passed to the
    high-level synthesis routine for a :class:`.MCMTGate`, leading to a failure or an
    invalid result. This issue could happen, for example, when handling the :class:`.MCMT`
    *circuit*, named ``"mcmt"``, and implicitly converting it into an instruction
    (e.g., when appending it to another circuit).
    Fixed `#13563 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/13563>`__.

    The high-level synthesis plugins for :class:`.LinearFunction` no longer raise an
    error when an object other than :class:`.LinearFunction` is passed into the ``run``
    method. Instead, they now return ``None``, which is consistent with other plugins.
    If you relied on this error being raised, you can manually perform an instance-check.
