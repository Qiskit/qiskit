    Fixed a bug where any instruction called ``"mcmt"`` would be passed into the high-level
    synthesis routine for a :class:`.MCMTGate`, which causes a failure or invalid result.
    In particular, this could happen accidentally when handling the :class:`.MCMT` _circuit_,
    named ``"mcmt"``, and implicitly converting it into an instruction e.g. when appending 
    it to a circuit.
    Fixed `#13563 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/13563>`__.
