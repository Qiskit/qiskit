    Support for macOS x86_64 has been downgraded from tier 1 to tier 2. This means that
    tests are no longer run on the platform for every proposed change to Qiskit and that
    the platform is only tested when building the wheels for publishing at release time.
    This change was due to Apple marking the platform support as deprecated and will no
    longer continue supporting the CPU architecture on their platform. Subsequently
    Github decreasing their support for using the platform in Github actions which Qiskit
    relies on for CI resources to run tests.

    While platform support hasn't been removed yet it is worth pointing out that this
    will likely happen in the lead up to Fall 2027 when Github has documented that they
    will retire the only images with support for running on x86_64 macOS. [#]_
