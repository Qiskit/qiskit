    Fixed an issue with copying circuits with new-style :class:`.Clbit`\ s and
    :class:`.Qubit`\ s (bits without registers) where references to these bits
    from the containing circuit could be broken, causing issues with
    serialization and circuit visualization.
    Fixed `#10409 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/10409>`__
