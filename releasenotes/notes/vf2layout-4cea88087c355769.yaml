    A new pass :class:`qiskit.transpiler.passes.VF2Layout` is
    introduced. This pass models the layout allocation problem as a subgraph
    isomorphism problem. For this, it uses VF2, a state of the art heuristic to find
    subgraphs. The pass works very much like :class:`qiskit.transpiler.passes.CSPLayout`.
