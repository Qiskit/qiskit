    The :class:`.OptimizeCliffordT` transpiler optimization pass has been
    significantly enhanced and reimplemented in Rust. 

    This pass performs a peephole optimization on circuits expressed
    using the "Clifford+T" gateset. More precisely, it collapses all chains
    of 1-qubit gates containing Clifford+T/Tdg into a minimal usage of T/Tdg. 
    For a chain containing :math:`m` gates, the pass runs in linear time,
    :math:`O(m)`.
