    Deprecate the ``QuantumCircuit`` methods ``u1``, ``u2`` and ``u3``.
    Instead the following replacements can be used.

    .. code-block::

        u1(theta) = p(theta) = u(0, 0, theta)
        u2(phi, lam) = u(pi/2, phi, lam) = p(pi/2 + phi) sx p(pi/2 lam)
        u3(theta, phi, lam) = u(theta, phi, lam) = p(phi + pi) sx p(theta + pi) sx p(lam)  

    The gate objects themselves, ``U1Gate``, ``U2Gate`` and ``U3Gate`` remain,
    to allow loading of old jobs.

    Note that ``U3Gate`` now has a definition in terms of the ``UGate`` but the ``UGate``
    has no definition. It is therefore not possible anymore to unroll *every* circuit in terms 
    of U3 and CX, but instead U and CX.
