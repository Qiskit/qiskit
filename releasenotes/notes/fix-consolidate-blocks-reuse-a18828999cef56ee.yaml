    Fixed re-use of the same :class:`.ConsolidateBlocks` instance on multiple circuits, including
    calls to :func:`.transpile` with more than one circuit and no process-based parallelization.  A
    bug introduced in Qiskit 2.2.2 caused the pass to panic or produce invalid output if the same
    instance was re-used on differing circuits.
