    Validation of :class:`qiskit.pulse.SymbolicPulse` objects can now be disabled. By setting
    the class attribute :attr:`qiskit.pulse.SymbolicPulse.disable_validation` to ``False``
    the method :meth:`validate_parameters` will not be triggered for all `SymbolicPulse` objects.
    The automatic validation hindered JAX compatibility of the symbolic pulse library, and this
    upgrade will make it easier to use Qiskit Pulse with JAX.

    Note that all library pulses automatically called :meth:`validate_parameters`. However, as part
    of the upgrade the call was moved directly to the initialization process of
    :class:`qiskit.pulse.SymbolicPulse`. While this doesn't change the behaviour of library pulses,
    custom symbolic pulses which did not call :meth:`validate_parameters` will now trigger the
    method. The new class attribute will allow to easily disable this.
