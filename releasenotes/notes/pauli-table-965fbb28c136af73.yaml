    Adds the :class:`qiskit.quantum_info.PauliTable` class. This is an efficient
    symplectic representation of a list of N-qubit Pauli operators. Some features
    of this class are:
 
      * PauliTables may be composed, and tensored which will return a PauliTable
        with the combination of the operation (
        :meth:`~qiskit.quantum_info.PauliTable.compose`,
        :meth:`~qiskit.quantum_info.PauliTable.dot`,
        :meth:`~qiskit.quantum_info.PauliTable.expand`,
        :meth:`~qiskit.quantum_info.PauliTable.tensor`) between each element of
        the first table, with each element of the second table.

      * Addition of two tables acts as list concatination of the terms in each
        table (``+``).
      
      * Pauli tables can be sorted by lexicographic (tensor product) order or
        by Pauli weights (:meth:`~qiskit.quantum_info.PauliTable.sort`).

      * Duplicate elements can be counted and deleted
        (:meth:`~qiskit.quantum_info.PauliTable.unique`).

      * The PauliTable may be iterated over in either its native symplectic
        boolean array representation, as Pauli string labels
        (:meth:`~qiskit.quantum_info.PauliTable.label_iter`), or as dense Numpy
        array or sparse CSR matrices
        (:meth:`~qiskit.quantum_info.PauliTable.matrix_iter`).

      * Checking commutation between elements of the Pauli table and another
        Pauli (:meth:`~qiskit.quantum_info.PauliTable.commutes`) or Pauli table
        (:meth:`~qiskit.quantum_info.PauliTable.commutes_with_all`)
    
    See the class API documentation for additional details.

    Adds :func:`qiskit.quantum_info.pauli_basis` function which returns an N-qubit
    Pauli basis as a :class:`qiskit.quantum_info.PauliTable` object. The ordering
    of this basis can either be by standard lexicographic (tensor product) order,
    or by the number of non-identity Pauli terms (weight).
