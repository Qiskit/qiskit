fixes:
  - |
    Fixed handling of globally defined instructions for the :class:`~.Target`
    class. Previously, two methods, :meth:`~.Target.operations_for_qargs` and
    :meth:`~.Target.operation_names_for_qargs` would ignore/incorrectly handle
    any globally defined ideal operations present in the target. For example::

        from qiskit.transpiler import Target
        from qiskit.circuit.library import CXGate

        target = Target(num_qubits=5)
        target.add_instruction(CXGate())
        names = target.operation_names_for_qargs((1, 2))
        ops = target.operations_for_qargs((1, 2))

    will now return ``{"cx"}`` for ``names`` and ``[CXGate()]`` for ``ops``
    instead of raising a ``KeyError`` or an empty return.

    Fixed an issue in the :meth:`.Target.add_instruction` method where it
    would previously have accepted an argument with an invalid number of
    qubits as part of the ``properties`` argument. For example::

        from qiskit.transpiler import Target
        from qiskit.circuit.library import CXGate

        target = Target()
        target.add_instruction(CXGate(), {(0, 1, 2): None})

    This will now correctly raise a ``TranspilerError`` instead of causing
    runtime issues when interacting with the target.
