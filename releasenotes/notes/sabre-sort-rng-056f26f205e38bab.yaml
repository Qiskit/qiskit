    Internal tweaks to the routing algorithm in :class:`.SabreSwap`, used in
    transpilation of non-dynamic circuits at all non-zero optimization levels,
    have sped up routing for very large circuits.  As an example, the time to
    route a depth-5 :class:`.QuantumVolume` circuit for a 1081-qubit heavy-hex
    coupling map is approximately halved.
