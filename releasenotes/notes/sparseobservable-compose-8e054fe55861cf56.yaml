  - |
    :class:`.SparseObservable` now supports operator composition using the
    :meth:`~.SparseObservable.compose` method, similar to other :mod:`.quantum_info` classes.
    This is analagous to matrix multiplication, though the method is entirely matrix free.
  - |
    :class:`.SparseObservable.BitTerm` as a new attribute, :attr:`~.SparseObservable.BitTerm.label`,
    which contains the single-character Python string used to represent the term in string labels.
