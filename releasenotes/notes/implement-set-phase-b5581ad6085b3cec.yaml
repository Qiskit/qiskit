    Added Phase instruction - :py:class:`~qiskit.pulse.SetPhase`. It sets the phase of the
    proceeding pulses to ``phase`` radians. For example::

       sched += SetPhase(3.14, DriveChannel(0))

    In this example, the phase of the pulses applied to ``DriveChannel(0)`` after the
    ``SetPhase`` instruction will be set to 3.14 radians.
