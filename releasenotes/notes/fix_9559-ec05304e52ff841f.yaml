    The Qiskit gates :class:`~.CCZGate`, :class:`~.CSGate`, :class:`~.CSdgGate` are not defined in
    ``qelib1.inc`` and, therefore, when dump as OpenQASM 2.0, their definition should be inserted in the file.
    Fixes `#9559 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/9559>`__,
    `#9721 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/9721>`__, and
    `#9722 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/9722>`__.
