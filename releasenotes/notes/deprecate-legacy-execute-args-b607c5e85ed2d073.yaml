deprecations:
  - |
    The following arguments of the :func:`~.execute` function are deprecated
    and will be removed in a future release:

    * ``basis_gates``
    * ``coupling_map``
    * ``backend_properties``
    * ``pass_manager``
    * ``shots``
    * ``memory``
    * ``seed_simulator``
    * ``default_qubit_los``
    * ``default_meas_los``
    * ``qubit_lo_range``
    * ``meas_lo_range``
    * ``meas_level``
    * ``meas_return``
    * ``memory_slots``
    * ``memory_slot_size``
    * ``rep_time``
    * ``rep_delay``
    * ``schedule_circuit``
    * ``inst_map``
    * ``meas_map``
    * ``scheduling_method``
    * ``init_qubits``

    The alternatives for each argument depend on their role and purpose. For flags
    that control the compilation you should use the :func:`~.tranpsile` and
    :func:`~.schedule` functions first and then pass the output to
    :meth:`~.BackendV2.run` method directly for the backend you wish to execute
    on. For arguments that control the runtime behavior of the backend, these
    will still work after removal, but they depend on the
    :attr:`~.BackendV2.options` attribute of the backend and whether they are
    supported or not by the backend. In the future these runtime option
    arguments will still be accepted even though the explict argument is
    no longer listed, but if the backend doesn't support them they will be
    ignored.
