    Qiskit's :func:`~.execute_function.execute` function is removed.
    This function served as a high-level wrapper around transpiling
    a circuit with some transpile options and running it on a backend
    with some run options. If you needed this functionality, consider staying in the 0.*
    edition until transition is possible for you. To do the same thing, you can explicitly
    use the :func:`~.transpile` function (with appropriate transpile
    options) followed by ``backend.run()`` (with appropriate run options).

    For example, instead of running::

      from qiskit import execute
      job = execute(circuit, backend)

    you can run::

      from qiskit import transpile
      new_circuit = transpile(circuit, backend)
      job = backend.run(new_circuit)

    Alternatively, the ``Sampler`` primitive is semantically equivalent to the
    deprecated :func:`~.execute_function.execute` function. The class
    :class:`.BackendSampler` is a generic wrapper for backends that do not support
    primitives:

      from qiskit.primitives import BackendSampler
      sampler = BackendSampler(backend)
      job = sampler.run(circuit)
