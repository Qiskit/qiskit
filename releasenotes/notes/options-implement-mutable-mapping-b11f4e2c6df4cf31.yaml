features:
  - |
    The :class:`qiskit.providers.options.Options` class now implements the
    :class`MutableMapping`. :class:`Options` instances therefore now offer the
    same interface as standard dictionaries.
    Key assignments are validated by the registered validators, if any.
    See `#9686 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/9686>`.
upgrade:
  - |
    Instances of `options.__dict__.items()` and related calls can be replaced
    by the same call without the `__dict__` proxy (e.g. `options.items()`).
