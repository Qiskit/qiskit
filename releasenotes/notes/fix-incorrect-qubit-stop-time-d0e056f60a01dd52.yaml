    Fixed a bug where :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.qubit_stop_time` and
    :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.qubit_duration` returned incorrect time (duration).
    The issue was triggered when some qubits have instructions but other qubits are idle.
    Fixes `#8729 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/8729>`__.
