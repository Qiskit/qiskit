features:
  - |
    New pass group :mod:`qiskit.transpiler.passes.scheduling.alignments` has been added.
    This consists of :class:`ConstrainedReschedule`, :class:`ValidatePulseGates`,
    and :class:`InstructionDurationCheck`. The new pass :class:`ConstrainedReschedule`
    considers both hardware alignment constraints of ``pulse_alignment`` and ``acquire_alignment``,
    which is a drop-in replacement of :class:`AlignMeasures`.
upgrade:
  - |
    The ordering of scheduling-relevant passes in the preset pass manager has been upgraded.
    Note that now scheduling passes and alignment passes are all sub-class of the
    :class:`AnalysisPass` that only updates the property set of the pass manager,
    in which new property set ``node_start_time`` is created there to perform
    these operation on nodes scheduled on the absolute time.

    Previously, the pass chain had been implemented as ``scheduling -> alignment``
    which were both transform passes thus there were multiple DAG instance regeneration.
    In addition, scheduling occured in each pass to obtain instruction start time.

    Now this chain becomes ``scheduling -> alignment -> padding``
    where the DAG replacement only occurs at the end, i.e. at the ``padding`` pass.
    Note that who wants to design a new pass manager must insert one of the padding passes
    at the end of the pass chain. Without the padding pass, the scheduled nodes
    are not reflected in the target code since the QASM payload has no notion of
    the scheduling for underlying instructions.
deprecations:
  - |
    Alignment pass :class:`AlignMeasures` has been deprecated and will be removed.
    The constructor of this pass now internally calls :class:`ConstrainedReschedule`
    and returns the instance of its instance.
