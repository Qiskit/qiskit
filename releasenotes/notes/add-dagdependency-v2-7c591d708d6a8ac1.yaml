    A new class, :class:`.DAGDependencyV2` has been added to the :mod:`qiskit.dagcircuit.dagdepencency_v2`
    module. This is a new version of :class:`.DAGDependency` and performs many of the same functions,
    including using commutativity to determine edge locations, but in a much more memory efficient way.
    In addition new methods have been added that are similar to those used in :class:`.DAGCircuit`.
    This allows ``DAGDependencyV2`` and ``DAGCircuit`` to be used interchangeably in some contexts,
    though the nature of the underlying DAGs are quite different.

    The 2 functions, :func:`qiskit.converters.circuit_to_dagdependency_v2` and
    :func:`qiskit.converters.dag_to_dagdependency_v2` have also been added in order to create a
    ``DAGDependencyV2`` from a ``QuantumCircuit`` or a ``DAGCircuit``.
