deprecations:
  - |
    Misspelled `aquire_alignment` in the class :class:`.Target` has been replaced by
    correct spelling `acquire_alignment`.
    The old constructor argument `aquire_alignment` and :attr:`.Target.aquire_alignment`
    are deprecated and will be removed.
    Use :attr:`.Target.acquire_alignment` instead to get and set the alignment constraint value.
