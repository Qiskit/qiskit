    The functions ``qiskit.visualization.state_visualization.num_to_latex_ket`` and ``qiskit.visualization.state_visualization.numbers_to_latex_terms`` 
    have been removed, as they were removed in Qiskit 0.40 (released in Jan 2023). For similar functionality, see sympy's ``nsimplify`` and ``latex`` functions.
