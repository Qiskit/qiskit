upgrade:
  - |
    The pulse ``buffer`` option found in :class:`qiskit.pulse.Channel` and
    :class:`qiskit.pulse.Schedule` was deprecated in Terra 0.11.0 and has now
    been removed. To add a delay on a channel or in a schedule, specify it
    explicitly in your Schedule with a Delay::

        sched = Schedule()
        sched += Delay(5)(DriveChannel(0))
  - |
    PulseChannelSpec was deprecated in Terra 0.11.0 and has now been removed.
    Use BackendConfiguration instead::

        config = backend.configuration()
        drive_chan_0 = config.drives(0)
        acq_chan_0 = config.acquires(0)

    or, simply reference the channel directly, such as ``DriveChannel(index)``.
  - |
    An import path was deprecated in Terra 0.10.0 and has now been removed: for
    ``PulseChannel``, ``DriveChannel``, ``MeasureChannel``, and
    ``ControlChannel``, use ``from qiskit.pulse.channels import X`` in place of
    ``from qiskit.pulse.channels.pulse_channels import X``.
