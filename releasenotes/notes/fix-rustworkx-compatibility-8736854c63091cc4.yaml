    Fixed a compatibility issue with the minimum supported version of
    `rustworkx <https://www.rustworkx.org/>`__, 0.15. With certain inputs
    the :class:`.VF2Layout` and :class:`.VF2PostLayout` were previously using
    a rustworkx method that was added in rustworkx 0.16.0 which would cause
    an error when using an older rustworkx release which is listed as
    supported.
