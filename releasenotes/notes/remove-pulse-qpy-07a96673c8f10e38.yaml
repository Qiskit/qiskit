    With the removal of Pulse in Qiskit 2.0, support for serializing ``ScheduleBlock`` programs
    via the :func:`qiskit.qpy.dump` function has been removed. Furthermore, in order to keep
    backward compatibility, users can still load payloads containing pulse data (i.e. either
    ``ScheduleBlock`` s or containing pulse gates) using the :func:`qiskit.qpy.load` function.
    However, pulse data is ignored, resulting with potentially partially specified circuits.
    In particular, loading a ``ScheduleBlock`` payload will result with a circuit having only
    a name and metadata. Loading a :class:`~.QuantumCircuit` payload with pulse gates will
    result with a circuit containing undefined custom instructions.
