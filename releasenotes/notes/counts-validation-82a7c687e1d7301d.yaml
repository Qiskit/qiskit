    Before this fix, the keys in the dict initializing
    :class:`qiskit.result.Counts` could in some cases be a hetereneous
    collection of arbitrary types. This was neither intended nor
    documented. This will now raise an error. Furthermore, the documentation has
    been updated to clarify allowed inputs.
