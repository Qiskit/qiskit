    Added a ``label`` parameter to the :class:`.Barrier` which now allows
    a user to enter a label for the ``barrier`` directive and the label
    will be printed at the top of the ``barrier`` in the `mpl`, `latex`,
    and `text` circuit drawers. Printing of existing ``snapshot`` labels
    to the 3 circuit drawers was also added.

    .. code-block:: python

      from qiskit import QuantumCircuit

      circuit = QuantumCircuit(2)
      circuit.h(0)
      circuit.h(1)
      circuit.barrier(label="After H")
      circuit.draw('mpl')
