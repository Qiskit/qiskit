upgrade:
  - |
    The `tweedledum <https://pypi.org/project/tweedledum/>`__ library which
    was previously an optional dependency has been made a requirement. This
    was done because of the wide use of the
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.PhaseOracle` (which depends on
    having tweedledum installed) with several algorithms
    from :mod:`qiskit.algorithms`.
  - |
    The optional extra ``full-featured-simulators`` which could previously used
    to install ``qiskit-aer`` with something like
    ``pip install qiskit-terra[full-featured-simulators]`` has been removed
    from the qiskit-terra package. If this was being used to install
    ``qiskit-aer`` with ``qiskit-terra`` instead you should rely on the
    `qiskit <https://pypi.org/project/qiskit/>`__ metapackage or just install
    qiskit-terra and qiskit-aer together with
    ``pip install qiskit-terra qiskit-aer``.
features:
  - |
    A new optional extra ``all`` has been added to the qiskit-terra package.
    This enables installing all the optional requirements with a single
    extra, for example: ``pip install 'qiskit-terra[all]'``, Previously, it
    was necessary to list all the extras individually to install all the
    optional dependencies simultaneously.
