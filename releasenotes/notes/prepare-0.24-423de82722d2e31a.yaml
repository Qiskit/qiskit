  This release is a major feature release that includes numerous new features
  and bugfixes.

  This release is the final release with support for running Qiskit
  with Python 3.7. Starting in the next minor version release Python >=3.8 will
  be required to run Qiskit.

  The highlights of this release:

  QuantumInstance, OpFlow, and algorithms usage deprecation
  ---------------------------------------------------------

  This release officially deprecates the :class:`~QuantumInstance` class (and
  its associated helper methods and classes), the :mod:`qiskit.opflow` module,
  and any usage of those in :mod:`qiskit.algorithms`. This deprecation comes
  from a long thread of work that started in Qiskit Terra 0.21.0 to refactor
  the :mod:`qiskit.algorithms` module to be based on the computational
  :mod:`~qiskit.primitives`. There are associated migration guides for any
  existing users to migrate to the new workflow:

    * ``QuantumInstance`` migration guide: https://qisk.it/qi_migration
    * ``Opflow`` migration guide: https://qisk.it/qi_migration
    * Algorithms migration guide: https://qisk.it/algo_migration

  OpenQASM2 improvements
  ----------------------

  This release includes a major refactoring for the OpenQASM 2.0 support
  in Qiskit. The first change is the introduction of a new parser for OpenQASM
  2.0 in the :mod:`qiskit.qasm2` module. This new module replaces the
  existing :mod:`qiskit.qasm` module. The new parser more explicit and
  correct relative to the language specification. It is also implemented in
  Rust and is significantly faster than the previous parser. Paired with the
  new parser the OpenQASM2.0 exporter underwent a large refactor that
  improved the correctness of the output when using the
  :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.qasm` method to generate QASM output from a
  :class:`~.QuantumCircuit` object.

  Transpiler support for devices with disjoint connectivity
  ---------------------------------------------------------

  The transpiler now supports targeting backends with disjoint connectivity.
  Previously, the transpiler only supported backends which were fully connected
  (where there is a path to run operations between all pairs of qubits in the
  backend). Now, if a backend has disconnected connectivity the transpiler is
  able to reason about how to apply layout (:ref:`layout_stage`) and
  routing (:ref:`routing_stage`) for the backend. If the input circuit is
  not able to be executed on the hardware given the lack of connectivity between
  connected components, a descriptive error will be returned.

  For example, the Heron device outlined in IBM Quantum's
  `hardware roadmap <https://research.ibm.com/blog/ibm-quantum-roadmap-2025>`__
  describes a future backend which will have shared control hardware
  and real-time classical communication between separate quantum processors.
  This support enables the :class:`~.Target` to accurately model these types
  of future devices or other hardware with similar constraints.

  Switch Operation
  ----------------

  This release adds a new control flow operation, the switch statement. This is
  implemented using a new operation class :class:`~.SwitchCaseOp` and the
  :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.switch` method. This allows switching on a numeric
  input (such as a classical register or bit) and executing the circuit that
  corresponds to the matching value.
