    Adds a global option `limit_amplitude` to the Pulse class to enable or disable the limit of 1. on the waveform
    amplitude. Fixes #6012.
    With the option enabled, the `Waveform` class does not allow amplitudes larger than 1. This is
    enforced in several subclasses such as `Gaussian` and `Constant`.
