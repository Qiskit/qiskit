    Binary arithmetic operations on :class:`.SparseObservable` have a slightly updated
    error message, if the two observables in the operation have incompatible numberss of qubits.
    Previously, the resulting ``ValueError`` contained the message
    ``incompatible numbers of qubits: A and B``, which now is
    ``mismatched numbers of qubits: A, B``.
