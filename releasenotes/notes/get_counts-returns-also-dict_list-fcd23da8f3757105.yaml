    Modified `get_counts()` to return a list of all the counts available when
    there are multiple circuits in a job. This works when `get_counts()` is
    called with no arguments but maintains the possibility to run single
    circuits.

    This feature is mainly thought for drawing in the same histogram all the
    counts of the result that contains the execution of multiple circuits.

    Hence, it is now possible to do something like:

          `plot_histogram(result.get_counts())`

    In this way it allows not to index by hand all the results or loop over
    the results of the experiment.
