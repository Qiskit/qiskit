    Added :class:'n_local.EvolvedOperatorAnsatz' in the n_local directory. 
    The basis of the class :class:'.EvolvedOperatorAnsatz' is NLocal and therefore
    this is the correct directory.

    The class :class:`.EvolvedOperatorAnsatz` is now deprecated and will be removed
    from the codebase in no less than 3 months from the release date. Its functionality
    was replaced with :class:`n_local.EvolvedOperatorAnsatz`, and can be totally
    replaced by it. Please use :meth:`.n_local.EvolvedOperatorAnsatz` instead.
