    The QFT circuit in the circuit library now computes the Fourier transform
    using a little-endian representation of tensors, i.e. the state
    :math:`|1\rangle` maps to :math:`|0\rangle - |1\rangle + |2\rangle - ..`
    assuming the computational basis correspond to little-endian bit ordering
    of the integers. :math:`|0\rangle = |000\rangle, |1\rangle = |001\rangle`,
    etc.
