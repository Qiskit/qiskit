    Fixed an issue with the :class:`~qiskit.compiler.schedule` function where
    previously passing in a ``list`` of :class:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit`
    objects with a single entry would incorrectly return a single
    :class:`~.Schedule` object instead of the expected ``list`` return type.
