    The :class:`.BasisTranslator` transpiler pass has been reimplemented
    to work purely in Rust, taking advantage of all the other structures
    that currently live there such as the :class:`.Target`, :class:`.EquivalenceLibrary`,
    and the :class:`.DAGCircuit`. The pass itself now runs anywhere from
    3x to 5x faster than it did in Python.
