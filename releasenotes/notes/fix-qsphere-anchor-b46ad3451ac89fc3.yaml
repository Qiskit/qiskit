    Fixed a visualization artifact in :func:`~qiskit.visualization.plot_state_qsphere` where
    symmetric entangled states (e.g., Bell states) were arbitrarily rotated due to floating-point
    noise. Previously, microscopic noise introduced by the internal eigensolver could cause the
    visualization to select the wrong basis state as the global phase anchor (Phase 0). A rounding
    step has been added to filter this noise, ensuring stable and canonical orientation for
    symmetric states.
