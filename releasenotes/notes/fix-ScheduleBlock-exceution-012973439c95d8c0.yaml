    Fixes the error in executing :obj:`.pulse.ScheduleBlock` on a ``PulseBackend``.
    Previously, ``execute`` did not correctly handle the execution of ``ScheduleBlock`` 
    and tried transpilation of ``pulse`` type circuits. The ``ScheduleBlock`` is now 
    run as a pulse schedule on the specified backend.
