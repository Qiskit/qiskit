    Add a new :meth:`.SparsePauliOp.from_sparse_list` constructor can now take an iterable where
    the elements represent Pauli terms that are themselves sparse, so that
    `"XIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIX"` can now be written as `("XX", [0, 16])`. For example, the operator

    .. math::

      H = X_0 Z_3 + 2 Y_1 Y_4

    can now be constructed as

    .. code-block:: python

      op = SparsePauliOp.from_sparse_list([("XZ", [0, 3], 1), ("YY", [1, 4], 2)], num_qubits=5)

      # or equivalently, as previously
      op = SparsePauliOp.from_list([("IZIIX", 1), ("YIIYI", 2)])

    This greatly facilitates the construction of very sparse operators on many qubits, as
    is often the case for Ising Hamiltonians.
