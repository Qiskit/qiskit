    Support the construction of a :class:`.SparsePauliOp` from a list of Paulis, specifying with
    an index on which qubits the Pauli act. For example, the operator

    .. math::

      H = X_0 Z_3 + 2 Y_1 Y_4

    can now be constructed as

    .. code-block:: python

      op = SparsePauliOp.from_list([("XZ", [0, 3], 1), ("YY", [1, 4])], num_qubits=5)

    This greatly facilitates the construction of very sparse operators on many qubits, as
    is e.g. often the case for Ising Hamiltonians.
