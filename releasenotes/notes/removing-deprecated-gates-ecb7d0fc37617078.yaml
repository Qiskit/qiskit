deprecations:
  - |
    The submodule ``qiskit.extensions.standard`` has been removed along with
    the deprecated gates in ``qiskit.extensions.quantum_initializer``.
    The correct import location for the standard gates is
    ``qiskit.circuit.library``, or ``qiskit.circuit.library.standard_gates``.
    All gates continue to be importable from ``qiskit.extensions``.
    Also, the deprecated ``QuantumCircuit.iden`` method has been removed.
