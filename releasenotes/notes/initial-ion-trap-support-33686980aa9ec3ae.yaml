features:
  - |
    Initial support for executing experiments on ion trap backends has been
    added.
  - |
    An Rxx gate (rxx) and a global Mølmer–Sørensen gate (ms) have been added
    to the standard gate set.
  - |
    A Cnot to Rxx/Rx/Ry decomposer ``cnot_rxx_decompose`` and a single qubit
    Euler angle decomposer ``OneQubitEulerDecomposer`` have been added to the
    ``quantum_info.synthesis`` module.
  - |
    A transpiler pass ``MSBasisDecomposer`` has been added to unroll circuits
    defined over U3 and Cnot gates into a circuit defined over Rxx,Ry and Rx.
    This pass will be included in preset pass managers for backends which
    include the 'rxx' gate in their supported basis gates.
