    Fixed an issue with the primitive classes, :class:`~.BackendSampler` and :class:`~.BackendEstimator`,
    where instances were not able to be serialized with ``pickle``. In general these classes are not guaranteed
    to be serializable as :class:`~.BackendV2` and :class:`~.BackendV1` instances are not required to be
    serializable (and often are not), but the class definitions of :class:`~.BackendSampler` and
    :class:`~.BackendEstimator` no longer prevent the use of ``pickle``.
