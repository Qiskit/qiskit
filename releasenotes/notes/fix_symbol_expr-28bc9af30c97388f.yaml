fixes:
  - |
    Fix for #14467, SymbolExpr accepts back slash when parsing string for `ParameterExpression.init`.
    Remove an optimization when dividing by integer value and keep as is, for example `a/2` was
    optimized as `0.5*a` before, but this broke some test cases.
    Instead add some optimizations when adding/subtracting 2 binary ops with division by integer,
    for example, `a/2 + a/2` is optimized as `a` or `a/2 - 0.5*a` is optimized as `0`.
    Fix displaying conjugate op as `conjugate` as similar to sympy instead of `conj` output before.
