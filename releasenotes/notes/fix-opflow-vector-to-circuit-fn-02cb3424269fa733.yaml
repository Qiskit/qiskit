    Previously it was not possible to adjoint a :class:`.CircuitStateFn` that has been
    constructed from a :class:`.VectorStateFn`. That's because the statevector has been
    converted to a circuit with the :class:`~qiskit.extensions.Initialize` instruction, which
    is not unitary. This problem is now fixed by instead using the :class:`.StatePreparation`
    instruction, which can be used since the state is assumed to start out in the all 0 state.

    For example we can now do::

        from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
        from qiskit.opflow import StateFn

        left = StateFn([0, 1])
        left_circuit = left.to_circuit_op().primitive

        right_circuit = QuantumCircuit(1)
        right_circuit.x(0)

        overlap = left_circuit.inverse().compose(right_circuit)  # this line raised an error before!
