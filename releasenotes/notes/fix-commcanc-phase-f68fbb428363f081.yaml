    Fixed a bug in the :class:`.CommutativeCancellation` transpiler pass (and thereby in
    :func:`.transpile`), where the global phase of the circuit was not correctly preserved.
    For example, optimizations merging Pauli gates with the corresponding Pauli rotation would
    induce a phase mismatch. Likewise, removing merged Pauli rotations, where the angle was
    :math:`(2 + 4k)\pi`, :math:`k \in \mathbb Z`, would produce a phase shift of :math:`-1`.
