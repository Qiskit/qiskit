features_transpiler:
  - |
    A new ``dt`` argument has been added to :func:`.generate_preset_pass_manager` to match
    the set of arguments of :func:`.transpile`. This will allow for the internal conversion 
    of transpilation constraints to a :class:`.Target` representation.
    
upgrade_transpiler:
  - |
    The :func:`.generate_preset_pass_manager` function has been upgraded to, when possible,
    internally convert transpiler constraints into a :class:`.Target` instance.
    If a `backend` input of type :class:`.BackendV1` is provided, it will be 
    converted to :class:`.BackendV2` to expose its :class:`.Target`. This change does 
    not require any user action.
