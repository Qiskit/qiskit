    Fixed an inconsistency in the circuit generated by a Pauli evolution synthesis
    with :class:`.SuzukiTrotter` or :class:`.LieTrotter` (the default) method.
    For parameterized evolution times, the resulting circuits contained parameters
    with a spurious, zero complex part, which affected the output of
    :meth:`.ParameterExpression.sympify`. The output now correctly is only real.
    Fixed `#13642 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/pull/13642>`__.
