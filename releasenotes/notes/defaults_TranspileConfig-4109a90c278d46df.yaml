upgrade:
  - |
    The ``TranspileConfig`` was restructured to include only the information
    needed to construct a ``PassManager`` and it was renamed to ``PassManagerConfig``.
    That information is:
    - ``initial_layout``
    - ``basis_gates``
    - ``coupling_map``
    - ``backend_properties``
    - ``seed_transpiler``
deprecations:
  - |
    ``PassManager(..., callback=..., ...)`` parameter is deprecated. The parameter now
    can be set at run-time, ``PassManager.run(..., callback=callback,...)``.
  - |
    The function ``transpile_circuit`` is deprecated. To transpile a circuit a
    passmanager's ``run`` method should be called ``PassManager.run(cirucit, ...)``.
