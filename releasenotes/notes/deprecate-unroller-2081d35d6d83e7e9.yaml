    The :class:`.Unroller` transpiler pass has been deprecated and will be removed
    in a future release. The :class:`.Unroller` has been superseded by the
    :class:`.BasisTranslator` which provides a similar set of functionality but
    offers it in a more general manner so that you're able to translate a circuit
    to any universal basis set. The :class:`.Unroller` class only works in situations
    where the circuit's gates definitions are recursively defined in terms of the target
    basis; for Qiskit's standard library gates this means :class:`.UGate` and
    :class:`.CXGate`. If you are using the :class:`.Unroller` pass it can be replaced by
    using a custom pass manager of the form::

        from qiskit.transpiler import PassManager
        from qiskit.transpiler.passes import UnrollCustomDefinitions, BasisTranslator
        from qiskit.circuit.equivalence_library import SessionEquivalenceLibrary as sel

        pm = PassManager(
            [
                UnrollCustomDefinitions(sel, basis_gates=basis_gates),
                BasisTranslator(sel, target_basis=basis_gates),
            ]
        )
        pm.run(circuit)

    The :attr:`.ControlledGate.definition` of the output from the :meth:`.Gate.control()` method
    may be different as compared to previous releases. The internal generation
    of the :meth:`.Gate.control` is no longer using the now deprecated
    :class:`.Unroller` transpiler pass to generate it's definition and this can
    potentially cause a different definition to be generated. The output
    :class:`.ControlledGate` object's definition will be unitary equivalent to what
    was generated before. But if you require the exact definition from calling
    :meth:`.Gate.control` you can use an earlier release and save the circuit with
    :func:`.qpy.dump` and then load it with a newer release.
