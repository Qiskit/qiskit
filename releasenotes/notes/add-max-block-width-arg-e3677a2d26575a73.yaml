    Add a new argument ``max_block_width`` to the class :class:`~BlockCollector`,
    and to the transpiler passes :class:`~CollectLinearFunctions` and :class:`~CollectCliffords`
    that are based on this class. 
    This argument enforces block collection strategies to restrict the maximum number of qubits 
    over which a block of nodes is defined.
