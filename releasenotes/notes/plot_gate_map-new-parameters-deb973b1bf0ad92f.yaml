    The function ``qiskit.visualization.plot_gate_mpa()`` has been extended with new parameters.
    If the backend argument is passed, the corresponding device's gate map will be plotted.
    If the backend argument is None, three new parameters must be passed; ``num_qubit``,
    ``qubit_coordinates``, and ``coupling_map``, which define a gate map to be plotted.
