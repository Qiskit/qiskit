upgrade:
  - |
    The class constructor arguments `qregs`, `cregs`, 
    `layout` and `global_phase` for :class:`.visualization.QCircuitImage`
    are removed, as they were deprecated in 0.20.
    
  - |
    In :class:`.transpiler.CouplingMap` method `subgraph` is removed
    as deprecated in 0.20. :meth:`~reduce` can be used in place of method `subgraph`.
  
  - |
    The parameter `order` in :class:`.synthesis.SuzukiTrotter`
    constructor raises an exception instead of deprecation warning when
    set in an odd number. Suzuki product formulae are symmetric and
    therefore only defined for even orders.
