    Fixed incorrect behavior in the :class:`.BasisTranslator` pass where a multi-qubit
    gate within a :class:`.ControlFlowOp` block would track supported operation with its local
    qubit indices instead of using the absolute indices of the outer circuit.
    Fixed `#13728 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/13728>`__.
