    The standard equivalence library (:data:`.SessionEquivalenceLibrary`) now has rules that can
    directly convert between Qiskit's standard-library 2q continuous Ising-type interactions (e.g.
    :class:`.CPhaseGate`, :class:`.RZZGate`, :class:`.RZXGate`, and so on) using local equivalence
    relations.  Previously, several of these conversions would go via a 2-CX form, which resulted
    in less efficient circuit generation.

    .. note::

      In general, the :class:`.BasisTranslator` is not guaranteed to find the "best" equivalence
      relation for a given :class:`.Target`, but will always find an equivalence if one exists.  We
      rely on more expensive resynthesis and gate-optimization passes in the transpiler to improve
      the output.  These passes are currently not as effective for basis sets with a continuously
      parametrized two-qubit interaction as they are for discrete super-controlled two-qubit
      interactions.
