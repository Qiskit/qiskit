    The OpenQASM 2 importer previously would output incorrect :class:`.Gate` instances for gate
    calls referring to a ``gate`` definition that followed a prior ``gate`` definition that was
    being treated as a built-in operation by a :class:`~.qasm2.CustomInstruction`.  See
    `#13339 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/13339>`__ for more detail.
