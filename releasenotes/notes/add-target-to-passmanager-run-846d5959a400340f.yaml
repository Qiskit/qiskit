    Added new argument ``target`` to :meth:`qiskit.passmanager.BasePassManager.run`.
    Given target is shared among scheduled passes, so that we don't need to set
    target object to individual passes. 

    .. code-block:: python

      pm = PassManager(...)
      pm.run(circuits, target=backend.target)

    In future we may drop target argument from the constructor of builtin passses.
