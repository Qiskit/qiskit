    The :class:`.BarrierBeforeFinalMeasurements` transpiler pass previously had a non-deterministic
    order of its emitted :class:`.Barrier` instructions.  This did not change the semantics of
    circuits but could, in limited cases where there were non-full-width barriers, cause later
    stochastic transpiler passes to see a different topological ordering of the circuit and
    consequently have different outputs for fixed seeds.  The pass has been made deterministic to
    avoid this.
