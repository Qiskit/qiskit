    The :class:`.BarrierBeforeFinalMeasurements` and :class:`.MergeAdjacentBarriers` transpiler
    passes previously had a non-deterministic order of their emitted :class:`.Barrier` instructions.
    This did not change the semantics of circuits but could, in limited cases where there were
    non-full-width barriers, cause later stochastic transpiler passes to see a different topological
    ordering of the circuit and consequently have different outputs for fixed seeds.  The passes
    have been made deterministic to avoid this.
