    Fixes `#15070 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/15070>`__.
    Added features for serializing and deserializing :class:`~qiskit.quantum_info.SparseObservable`
    in QPY format. This preserves the sparse format.

    The QPY format version has been upgraded to 17 to accommodate this change. This required changes in
    :func:`_write_pauli_evolution_gate` and :func:`_read_pauli_evolution_gate` functions in
    :mod:`qiskit.qpy.binary_io.circuits` and addition of new format definitions in
    :mod:`qiskit.qpy.formats`.
