deprecations:
  - |
    The loose functions ``qiskit.circuit.measure.measure()`` and
    ``qiskit.circuit.reset.reset()`` are deprecated, and will be removed in a
    future release.  Instead, you should access these as methods on
    :class:`.QuantumCircuit`::

        from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
        circuit = QuantumCircuit(1, 1)

        # Replace this deprecated form ...
        from qiskit.circuit.measure import measure
        measure(circuit, 0, 0)

        # ... with either of the next two lines:
        circuit.measure(0, 0)
        QuantumCircuit.measure(circuit, 0, 0)

fixes:
  - |
    Two loose functions ``qiskit.circuit.measure.measure()`` and
    ``qiskit.circuit.reset.reset()`` were accidentally removed without a
    deprecation period.  They have been reinstated, but are marked as deprecated
    in favour of the methods :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.measure` and
    :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.reset`, respectively, and will be removed in a future
    release.
