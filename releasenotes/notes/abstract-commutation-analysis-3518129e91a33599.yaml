    Extended the commutation analysis performed by :class:`.CommutationChecker` to only operate on
    hardware circuits to also work with abstract circuits, i.e. each operation in
    the input quantum circuit is now checked for its matrix representation before proceeding to the
    analysis. In addition, the operation is now checked for its ability to be cached in the session
    commutation library. For example, this now enables computing whether :class:`.AnnotatedOperation`
    commute. This enables transpiler passes that rely on :class:`.CommutationChecker` internally,
    such as :class:`.CommutativeCancellation`, during earlier stages of a default transpilation pipeline
    (prior to basis translation).
