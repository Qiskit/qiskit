    When extending a :class:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit` instance
    (extendee) with another circuit (extension), the circuit is taken via
    reference. If a circuit is extended with itself that leads to an infinite
    loop as extendee and extension are the same. This bug has been resolved by
    copying the extension if it is the same object as the extendee.
    Fixes `#3811 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/3811>`_
