    :func:`qiskit.compiler.transpile` (and :func:`qiskit.execute.execute`,
    which uses ``transpile`` internally) will now raise an error when the
    ``pass_manager`` kwarg is set and a value is set for other kwargs that
    are already set in an instantiated :class:`~qiskit.transpiler.PassManager`
    object. Previously, these conflicting kwargs would just be silently
    ignored and the values in the ``PassManager`` instance would be used. For
    example::

        from qiskit.circuit import QuantumCircuit
        from qiskit.transpiler.pass_manager_config import PassManagerConfig
        from qiskit.transpiler import preset_passmanagers
        from qiskit.compiler import transpile

        qc = QuantumCircuit(5)

        config = PassManagerConfig(basis_gates=['u3', 'cx'])
        pm = preset_passmanagers.level_0_pass_manager(config)
        transpile(qc, optimization_level=3, pass_manager=pm)

    will now raise an error while prior to this release the value in ``pm``
    would just silently be used and the value for the ``optimization_level``
    kwarg would be ignored. The ``transpile`` kwargs this applies to are:

    * ``optimization_level``
    * ``basis_gates``
    * ``coupling_map``
    * ``seed_transpiler``
    * ``backend_properties``
    * ``initial_layout``
    * ``layout_method``
    * ``routing_method``
    * ``backend``
