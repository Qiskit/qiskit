    The 0.13.0 release includes several new features and bug fixes. There are
    many big changes this release.

    For the transpiler we have switched the graph library used to build the
    :class:`qiskit.dagcircuit.DAGCircuit` class which is the underlying data
    structure behind all operations to be based on
    `retworkx <https://pypi.org/project/retworkx/>`_ for greatly improved
    performance. Circuit transpilation speed in the 0.13.0 release should

    A library of quantum circuits is introduced in
    :mod:`qiskit.circuit.library`. This library contains useful circuits which
    can be used for experiments or be used as subcircuits in building up other
    circuits. The contents of this library will grow over time and better
    implementations will be introduced.

    --- Pulse TODO ---

    --- Quantum Info TODO ---

    This release also has vastly improved documentation across Qiskit,
    including improved documentation for the :mod:`qiskit.circuit`,
    :mod:`qiskit.pulse` and :mod:`qiskit.quantum_info` modules.

    For full details on all the changes made in this release see the detailed
    release notes below.
