    A new instruction :py:class:`~qiskit.pulse.SetFrequency` which allows users
    to change the frequency of the :class:`~qiskit.pulse.PulseChannel`. This is
    done in the following way::

        from qiskit.pulse import Schedule
        from qiskit.pulse import SetFrequency

        sched = pulse.Schedule()
        sched += SetFrequency(5.5e9, DriveChannel(0))

    In this example, the frequency of all pulses before the ``SetFrequency``
    command will be the default frequency and all pulses applied to drive
    channel zero after the ``SetFrequency`` command will be at 5.5 GHz. Users
    of ``SetFrequency`` should keep in mind any hardware limitations.
