features:
  - |
    A new jupyter widget, ``%circuit_library_info`` has been added to
    :mod:`qiskit.tools.jupyter`. This widget is used for visualizing
    details about circuits built from the circuit library. For example

    .. jupyter-execute::

        from qiskit.circuit.library import XOR
        import qiskit.tools.jupyter
        circuit = XOR(5, seed=42)
        %circuit_library_info circuit

  - |
    A new kwarg option, ``formatted`` ,  has been added to
    :meth:`qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.qasm` . When set to ``True`` the
    the method will print a syntax highlighted version (using pygments) to
    stdout and return ``None`` (which differs from the normal behavior of
    returning the QASM code as a string).
  - |
    A new kwarg option, ``filename`` , has been added to
    :meth:`qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.qasm`. When set to a path the method
    will write the QASM code to that file. It will then continue to output as
    normal.
upgrade:

    A new optional visualization requirement,
    `pygments <https://pygments.org/>`_ , has been added. It is used for
    providing syntax highlighting of OpenQASM 2.0 code in Jupyter widgets and
    optionally for the :meth:`qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.qasm` method. It
    must be installed (either with ``pip install pygments`` or
    ``pip install qiskit-terra[visualization]``) prior to using the
    ``%circuit_library_info`` widget in :mod:`qiskit.tools.jupyter` or
    the ``formatted`` kwarg on the :meth:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.qasm`
    method.
