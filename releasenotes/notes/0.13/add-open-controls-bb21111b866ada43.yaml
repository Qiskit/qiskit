    Add ability to specify control conditioned on a qubit being in the
    ground state. The state of the control qubits is represented by an
    integer. For example::

      from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
      from qiskit.extensions.standard import XGate

      qc = QuantumCircuit(4)
      cgate = XGate().control(3, ctrl_state=6)
      qc.append(cgate, [0, 1, 2, 3])

    Creates a four qubit gate where the fourth qubit gets flipped if
    the first qubit is in the ground state and the second and third
    qubits are in the excited state. If ``ctrl_state`` is ``None``, the
    default, control is conditioned on all control qubits being
    excited.
