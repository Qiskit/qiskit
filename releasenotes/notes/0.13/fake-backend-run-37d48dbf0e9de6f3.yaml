    The mock backends in ``qiskit.test.mock`` now have a functional ``run()``
    method that will return results similar to the real devices. If
    ``qiskit-aer`` is installed a simulation will be run with a noise model
    built from the device snapshot in the fake backend.  Otherwise,
    :class:`qiskit.providers.basicaer.QasmSimulatorPy` will be used to run an
    ideal simulation. Additionally, if a pulse experiment is passed to ``run``
    and qiskit-aer is installed the ``PulseSimulator`` will be used to simulate
    the pulse schedules.
