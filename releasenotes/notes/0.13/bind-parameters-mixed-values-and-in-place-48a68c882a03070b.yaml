    A new method, :meth:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.assign_parameters`
    has been added to the :class:`qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit` class. This
    method accepts a parameter dictionary with both floats and Parameters
    objects in a single dictionary. In other words this new method allows you
    to bind floats, Parameters or both in a single dictionary.

    Also, by using the ``inplace`` kwarg it can be specified you can optionally
    modify the original circuit in place. By default this is set to ``False``
    and a copy of the original circuit will be returned from the method.
