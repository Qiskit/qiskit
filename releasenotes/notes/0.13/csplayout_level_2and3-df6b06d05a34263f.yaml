    The pass :class:`qiskit.transpiler.passes.CSPLayout` (which was introduced
    in the 0.11.0 release) has been added to the preset pass manager for
    optimization levels 2 and 3. For level 2, there is a call limit of 1,000
    and a timeout of 10 seconds. For level 3, the call limit is 10,000 and the
    timeout is 1 minute.

    Now that the pass is included in the preset pass managers the
    `python-constraint <https://pypi.org/project/python-constraint/>`_ package
    is not longer an optional dependency and has been added to the requirements
    list.
