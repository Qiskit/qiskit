    Adds the ability to set ``qargs`` to objects which are subclasses
    of the abstract ``BaseOperator`` class. This is done by calling the
    object ``op(qargs)`` (where ``op`` is an operator class) and will return
    a shallow copy of the original object with a qargs property set. When
    such an object is used with the
    :meth:`~qiskit.quantum_info.Operator.compose` or
    :meth:`~qiskit.quantum_info.Operator.dot` methods the internal value for
    qargs will be used when the ``qargs`` method kwarg is not used. This
    allows for subsystem composition using binary operators, for example::

        from qiskit.quantum_info import Operator

        init = Operator.from_label('III')
        x = Operator.from_label('X')
        h = Operator.from_label('H')
        init @ x([0]) @ h([1])
