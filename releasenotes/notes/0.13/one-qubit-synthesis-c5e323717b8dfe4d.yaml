features:
  - |
    Two new methods, :meth:`~qiskit.quantum_info.OneQubitEulerDecomposer.angles`
    and :meth:`~qiskit.quantum_info.OneQubitEulerDecomposer.angles_and_phase`,
    have been added to the :class:`qiskit.quantum_info.OneQubitEulerDecomposer`
    class. These methods will return the relevant parameters without
    validation, and calling the ``OneQubitEulerDecomposer`` object will
    perform the full synthesis with validation.
  - |
    An ``RR`` decomposition basis has been added to the
    :class:`qiskit.quantum_info.OneQubitEulerDecomposer` for decomposing an
    arbitrary 2x2 unitary into a two :class:`~qiskit.extensions.RGate`
    circuit.
deprecations:
  - |
    The function ``qiskit.quantum_info.synthesis.euler_angles_1q`` is now
    deprecated. It has been superseded by the
    :class:`qiskit.quantum_info.OneQubitEulerDecomposer` class which provides
    the same functionality through::

        OneQubitEulerDecomposer().angles(mat)
