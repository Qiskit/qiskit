    Previously, for circuits containing composite gates (those created via
    :meth:`qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.to_gate` or
    :meth:`qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.to_instruction` or their corresponding
    converters), attempting to bind the circuit more than once would result in
    only the first bind value being applied to all circuits when transpiled.
    This has been resolved so that the values provided for subsequent binds are
    correctly respected.
