    The following properties of
    :py:class:`~qiskit.providers.models.BackendConfiguration`:

    * ``dt``
    * ``dtm``
    * ``rep_time``

    all have units of seconds. Prior to release 0.11.0, ``dt`` and ``dtm`` had
    units of nanoseconds. Prior to release 0.12.0, ``rep_time`` had units of
    microseconds. The warnings alerting users of these changes have now been
    removed from ``BackendConfiguration``.
