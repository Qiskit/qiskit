upgrade:
  - |
    The ``TranspileConfig`` class which was previously used to set
    run time configuration for a :class:`qiskit.transpiler.PassManager` has
    been removed and replaced by a new class
    :class:`qiskit.transpile.PassManagerConfig`. This new class has been
    structured to include only the information needed to construct a
    :class:`~qiskit.transpiler.PassManager`. The attributes of this class are:

    * ``initial_layout``
    * ``basis_gates``
    * ``coupling_map``
    * ``backend_properties``
    * ``seed_transpiler``
  - |
    The function ``transpile_circuit`` in
    :mod:`qiskit.transpiler` has been removed. To transpile a circuit with a
    custom :class:`~qiskit.transpiler.PassManager` now you should use the
    :meth:`~qiskit.transpiler.PassManager.run` method of the
    :class:~qiskit.transpiler.PassManager` object.

deprecations:
  - |
    The ``callback`` kwarg of the :class:`qiskit.transpiler.PassManager` class's
    constructor has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
    Instead of setting it at the object level during creation it should now
    be set as a kwarg parameter on the :meth:`qiskit.transpiler.PassManager.run`
    method.
