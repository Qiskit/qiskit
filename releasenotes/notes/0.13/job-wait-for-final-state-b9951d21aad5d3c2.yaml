    The :class:`qiskit.providers.BaseJob` class now has a new method
    :meth:`~qiskit.providers.BaseJob.wait_for_final_state` that polls for the
    job status until the job reaches a final state (such as ``DONE`` or
    ``ERROR``). This method also takes an optional ``callback`` kwarg which
    takes a Python callable that will be called during each iteration of the
    poll loop.
