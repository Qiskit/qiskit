    The :class:`~qiskit.transpiler.passes.BarrierBeforeFinalMeasurements`
    transpiler pass, included in the preset transpiler levels when targeting
    a physical device, previously inserted a barrier across only measured
    qubits. In some cases, this allowed the transpiler to insert a swap after a
    measure operation, rendering the circuit invalid for current
    devices. The pass has been updated so that the inserted barrier
    will span all qubits on the device. Fixes
