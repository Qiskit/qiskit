    Previously, replacing :class:`~qiskit.circuit.Parameter` instances in a
    circuit with new Parameter objects prior to decomposing a circuit would
    result in the substituted values not correctly being substituted into the
    decomposed gates. This has been resolved such that binding and
    decomposition may occur in any order.
