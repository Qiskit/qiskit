deprecations:
  - |
    The ``pass_manager`` kwarg for the :func:`qiskit.compiler.transpile`
    has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Moving forward
    the preferred way to transpile a circuit with a custom
    :class:`~qiskit.transpiler.PassManager` object is to use the
    :meth:`~qiskit.transpiler.PassManager.run` method of the ``PassManager``
    object.
