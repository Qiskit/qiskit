    The :class:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit` method
    :meth:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.draw` and
    :func:`qiskit.visualization.circuit_drawer` function will no longer include
    the initial state included in visualizations by default. If you would like to
    retain the initial state in the output visualization you need to set the
    ``initial_state`` kwarg to ``True``. For example, running:

    .. jupyter-execute::

        from qiskit import QuantumCircuit

        circuit = QuantumCircuit(2)
        circuit.measure_all()
        circuit.draw(output='text')

    This no longer includes the initial state. If you'd like to retain it you can run:

    .. jupyter-execute::

        from qiskit import QuantumCircuit

        circuit = QuantumCircuit(2)
        circuit.measure_all()
        circuit.draw(output='text', initial_state=True)

    A new kwarg, ``initial_state`` has been added to the
    :func:`qiskit.visualization.circuit_drawer` function and the
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit` method
    :meth:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.draw`. When set to ``True`` the
    initial state will be included in circuit visualizations for all backends.
    For example:
    
    .. jupyter-execute::
    
        from qiskit import QuantumCircuit

        circuit = QuantumCircuit(2)
        circuit.measure_all()
        circuit.draw(output='mpl', initial_state=True)
