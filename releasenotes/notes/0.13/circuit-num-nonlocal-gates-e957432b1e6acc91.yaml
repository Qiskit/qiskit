    A new method :meth:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.num_nonlocal_gates`
    has been added to the :class:`qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit` class.
    This method will return the number of gates in a circuit that involve 2 or
    or more qubits. These gates are more costly in terms of time and error to
    implement.
