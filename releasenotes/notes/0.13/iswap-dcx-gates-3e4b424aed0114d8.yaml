    Two new gate classes, :class:`qiskit.extensions.iSwapGate` and
    :class:`qiskit.extensions.DCXGate`, along with their
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit` methods
    :meth:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.iswap` and
    :meth:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.dcx` have been added to the standard
    extensions. These gates, which are locally equivalent to each other, can be
    used to enact particular XY interactions. A brief motivation for these gates
    can be found in:
