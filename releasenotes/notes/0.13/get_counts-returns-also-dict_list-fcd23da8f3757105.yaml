    The :meth:`qiskit.result.Result` method
    :meth:`~qiskit.result.Result.get_counts` will now return a list of all the
    counts available when there are multiple circuits in a job. This works when
    ``get_counts()`` is called with no arguments.

    The main consideration for this feature was for drawing all the results
    from multiple circuits in the same histogram. For example it is now
    possible to do something like:

    .. jupyter-execute::

        from qiskit import execute
        from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
        from qiskit.providers.basicaer import BasicAer
        from qiskit.visualization import plot_histogram

        sim = BasicAer.get_backend('qasm_simulator')

        qc = QuantumCircuit(2)
        qc.h(0)
        qc.cx(0, 1)
        qc.measure_all()
        result = execute([qc, qc, qc], sim).result()

        plot_histogram(result.get_counts())
