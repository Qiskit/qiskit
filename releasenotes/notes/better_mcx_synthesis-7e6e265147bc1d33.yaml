    Added new MCX gate decompositions utilising conditionally clean ancillae, improving circuit
    depth and efficiency. New synthesis methods `synth_mcx_1_clean_kg24`, `synth_mcx_`_dirty_kg24`,
    `synth_mcx_2_clean_kg24`, `synth_mcx_2_dirty_kg24` have been added to
    `qiskit/synthesis/multi_controlled/mcx_synthesis.py`.
    Example usage:
    .. code-block:: python
        
        from qiskit.synthesis.multi_controlled import synth_mcx_1_clean_kg24
        
        n_ctrls = 10
        qc = synth_mcx_1_clean_kg24(n_ctrls)
        qc.draw()
