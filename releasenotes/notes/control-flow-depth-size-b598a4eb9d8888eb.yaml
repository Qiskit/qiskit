    The circuit method :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.depth`, and the :class:`.DAGCircuit`
    methods :meth:`~.DAGCircuit.depth` and :meth:`~.DAGCircuit.size` gained a
    ``recurse`` keyword argument for use with control flow.  By default this is
    ``False`` and will raise an error if control-flow is present, to avoid
    nonsensical results.  If set to ``True``, a hint to the true value is returned,
    even though the exact number is generally unknowable.  See each method's
    documentation for how each control-flow operation affects the output.

    :meth:`.DAGCircuit.count_ops` gained a ``recurse`` keyword argument for
    recursing into control-flow blocks.  By default this is ``True``, and all
    operations in all blocks will be returned, as well as the control-flow
    operations themselves.
