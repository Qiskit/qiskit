    The :attr:`.DAGOpNode.sort_key`, :attr:`.DAGOutNode.sort_key`, and
    :attr:`.DAGInNode.sort_key` attributes have been deprecated and will be
    removed in the Qiskit 2.0.0 release. This attribute was originally used
    as a lexicographical key for topological sorting nodes in
    a :class:`.DAGCircuit`. However, the key is no longer used for this
    as the sorting is done internally in Rust code now. If you're using this
    attribute for anything you can recreate the key from the other attributes
    of a node. For example, you can use a function like::

        def get_sort_key(node: DAGNode):
            if isinstance(node, (DAGInNode, DAGOutNode)):
                return str(node.wire)
            return ",".join(
                f"{dag.find_bit(q).index:04d}" for q in itertools.chain(node.qargs, node.cargs)
            )

    which will generate a string like the sort key does.
