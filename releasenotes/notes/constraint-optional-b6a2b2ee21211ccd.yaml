    The ``python-constraint`` dependency, which is used solely by the
    :class:`~.CSPLayout` transpiler pass, is no longer in the requirements list
    for the Qiskit Terra package. This is because the :class:`~.CSPLayout` pass
    is no longer used by default in any of the preset pass managers for
    :func:`~.transpile`. While the pass is still available, if you're using it
    you will need to manually install ``python-contraint`` or when you
    install ``qiskit-terra`` you can use the ``csp-layout`` extra, for example::

        pip install "qiskit-terra[csp-layout]"
