    :class:`~qiskit.test.mock.fake_mumbai_v2.FakeMumbaiV2` has been renamed to
    `FakeMumbaiFractionalCX` to avoid name conflict with the newer
    :class:`~qiskit.test.mock.backends.FakeMumbaiV2` inherited from
    :class:`~qiskit.test.fake_backend.FakeBackendV2` which creates fake backend
    based on device snapshot payload files instead of hardcoded instruction
    properties.
