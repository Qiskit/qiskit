    Fixed an issue with the primitive classes, :class:`~.BackendSampler` and
    :class:`~.BackendEstimator` when running on backends that have a limited
    number of circuits in each job. Not all backends support an unlimited
    batch size (most hardware backends do not) and previously the backend
    primitive classes would have potentially incorrectly sent more circuits
    than the backend supported. This has been corrected so that
    :class:`~.BackendSampler` and :class:`~.BackendEstimator` will chunk the
    circuits into multiple jobs if the backend has a limited number of
    circuits per job.

    Fixed an issue with the :class:`~.BackendEstimator` class where previously
    setting a run option named ``monitor`` to a value that evaluated as
    ``True`` would have incorrectly triggered a job monitor that only
    worked on backends from the ``qiskit-ibmq-provider`` package. This
    has been removed so that you can use a ``monitor`` run option if needed
    without causing any issues.
