    Added a new function :func:`qiskit.synthesis.synth_cnot_phase_aam`
    which is used to synthesize cnot phase circuits for all-to-all architectures
    using the  Amy, Azimzadeh, and Mosca method. This function is identical to
    the available ``qiskit.transpiler.synthesis.graysynth()``
    function but has a more descriptive name and is more logically placed
    in the package tree. This new function supersedes the legacy function
    which will likely be deprecated in a future release.
