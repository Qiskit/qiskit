    The :class:`~.SabreLayout` pass now supports running against a target
    with a disjoint :class:`~.CouplingMap`. When targeting a disjoint coupling
    the input :class:`.DAGCircuit` is split into its connected components of
    virtual qubits, each component is mapped to the connected components
    of the :class:`~.CouplingMap`, layout is run on each connected
    component in isolation, and then all layouts are combined and returned.
    Note when the ``routing_pass`` argument is set the pass doesn't
    support running with disjoint connectivity.
