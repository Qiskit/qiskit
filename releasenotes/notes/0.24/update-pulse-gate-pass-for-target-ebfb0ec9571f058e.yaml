    A new method :meth:`.CalibrationEntry.user_provided` has been added to
    calibration entries. This method can be called to check whether the entry
    is defined by an end user or backend.
  - |
    Added a new method :meth:`.Target.get_calibration` which provides
    convenient access to the calibration of an instruction in a :class:`~.Target` object
    This method can be called with parameter args and kwargs, and
    it returns a pulse schedule built with parameters when the calibration
    is templated with parameters.

    :meth:`.Target.update_from_instruction_schedule_map` no longer raises
    ``KeyError`` nor ``ValueError`` when qubits are missing in the target instruction
    or ``inst_name_map`` is not provided for the undefined instruction.
    In the former case, it just ignores the input :class:`~.InstructionScheduleMap`\'s
    definition for undefined qubits. In the latter case, a gate mapping is pulled from
    the standard Qiskit gates and finally, a custom opaque :class:`.Gate` object is defined
    from the schedule name if no mapping is found.
