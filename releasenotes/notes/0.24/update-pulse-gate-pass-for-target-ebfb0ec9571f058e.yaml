features:
  - |
    A new method :meth:`.CalibrationEntry.user_provided` has been added to
    calibration entries. This method can be called to check whether the entry
    is defined by an end user or backend.
  - |
    New method :meth:`.Target.calibration_supported` and
    :meth:`.Target.get_calibration` have been added to provide
    convenient access to the calibration of instruction.
    The getter method can be called with parameter args and kwargs, and
    it returns a pulse schedule built with parameters when the calibration
    is templated with parameters.
upgrade:
  - |
    :meth:`.Target.update_from_instruction_schedule_map` no longer raises
    KeyError nor ValueError when qubits are missing in the target instruction
    or inst_name_map is not provided for undefined instruction.
    In the former case, it just ignores the inst map definition for undefined qubits.
    In the latter case, gate mapping is pulled from the standard Qiskit gates
    and finally custom :class:`.Gate` object is defined from the schedule name.
