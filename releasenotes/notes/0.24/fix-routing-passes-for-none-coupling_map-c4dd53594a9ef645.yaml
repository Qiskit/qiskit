    Fixed the transpiler routing passes :class:`~.StochasticSwap`,
    :class:`~.SabreSwap`, :class:`~.LookaheadSwap`, and :class:`~.BasicSwap`
    so that they consistently raise a :class:`~.TranspilerError` when their
    respective ``.run()`` method is called if the passes were initialized
    with ``coupling_map=None``. Previously, these passes would raise errors
    in this case but they were all caused by side effects and the specific
    exception was not predictable.
    Fixed `#7127 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/7127>`__
