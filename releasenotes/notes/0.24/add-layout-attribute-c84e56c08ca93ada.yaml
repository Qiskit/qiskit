    Added a new attribute, :attr:`~.QuantumCircuit.layout`, to the
    :class:`~.QuantumCircuit` class. This attribute is typically populated
    by :func:`~.transpile` or :class:`.PassManager.run` (when the
    :ref:`layout_stage` and :ref:`routing_stage` are run in the
    :class:`~PassManager`) and contains a :class:`~.TranspileLayout` which
    contains the information about the permutation of the input circuit
    during :class:`~.transpile`.
