    The deprecated ``max_credits`` argument to :func:`~.execute_function.execute`, :func:`~.compiler.assemble` and all
    of the ``Qobj`` configurations (e.g. :class:`.QasmQobjConfig` and
    :class:`.PulseQobjConfig`) has been removed. This argument dates back
    to early versions of Qiskit which was tied more closely to the IBM
    Quantum service offering. At that time the ``max_credits`` field was part
    of the "credit system" used by IBM Quantum's service offering. However,
    that credit system has not been in use on IBM Quantum backends for
    nearly three years and also Qiskit is not tied to IBM Quantum's service
    offerings anymore (and hasn't been for a long time). If you were relying on
    this option in some way for a backend you will need to ensure that your
    :class:`~.BackendV2` implementation exposes a ``max_credits`` field in
    its :class:`~.Options` object.
