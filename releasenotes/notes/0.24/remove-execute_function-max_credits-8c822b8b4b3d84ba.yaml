    The ``max_credits`` argument to :func:`~.execute_function.execute`, :func:`~.compiler.assemble` and all
    of the ``Qobj`` configurations (e.g. :class:`.QasmQobjConfig` and
    :class:`.PulseQobjConfig`) has been removed.
    The credit system has not been in use on IBM Quantum backends for
    nearly three years, and the option has no effect.  No alternative is necessary.
