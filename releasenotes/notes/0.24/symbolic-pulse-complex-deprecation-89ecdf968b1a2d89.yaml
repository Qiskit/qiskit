    Assignment of complex values to ``ParameterExpression`` in any Qiskit Pulse object
    now raises a ``PendingDeprecationWarning``. This will align the Pulse module with
    other modules where such assignment wasn't possible to begin with. The typical use
    case for complex parameters in the module was the SymbolicPulse library. As of
    Qiskit-Terra 0.23.0 all library pulses were converted from complex amplitude
    representation to real representation using two floats (amp,angle), as used in the
    ``ScalableSymbolicPulse`` class. This eliminated the need for complex parameters.
    Any use of complex parameters (and particularly custom-built pulses) should be
    converted in a similar fashion to avoid the use of complex parameters.
