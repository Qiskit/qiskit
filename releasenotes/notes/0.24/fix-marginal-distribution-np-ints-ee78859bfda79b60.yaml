    Fixed an issue with the :func:`~.marginal_distribution` function where it
    would incorrectly raise an error when an input counts dictionary was using
    a numpy integer type instead of the Python int type. The underlying function
    always would handle the different types correctly, but the input type
    checking was previously incorrectly raising a ``TypeError`` in this case.
