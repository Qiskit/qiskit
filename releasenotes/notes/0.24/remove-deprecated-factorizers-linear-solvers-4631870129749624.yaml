    The deprecated modules ``factorizers`` and ``linear_solvers``, containing
    ``HHL`` and ``Shor`` have been removed from
    :mod:`qiskit.algorithms`. These functionalities
    were originally deprecated as part of the 0.22.0 release (released on
    October 13, 2022). You can access the code through the Qiskit Textbook instead:
    `Linear Solvers (HHL) <https://learn.qiskit.org/course/ch-applications/solving-linear-systems-of-equations-using-hhl-and-its-qiskit-implementation>`_ ,
    `Factorizers (Shor) <https://learn.qiskit.org/course/ch-algorithms/shors-algorithm>`_
