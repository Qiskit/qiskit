    Manually setting an item in :attr:`.QuantumCircuit.data` will now correctly allow the operation
    to be any object that implements :class:`.Operation`, not just a :class:`.circuit.Instruction`.
    Note that any manual mutation of :attr:`.QuantumCircuit.data` is discouraged; it is not
    *usually* any more efficient than building a new circuit object, as checking the invariants
    surrounding parametrised objects can be surprisingly expensive.
