    Added a new function, :func:`~.staged_pass_manager_drawer`, which is used
    for visualizing a :class:`~.StagedPassManager` instance. It draws the full
    pass manager with each stage represented as an outer box.

    For example::

       from qiskit.visualization import staged_pass_manager_drawer
       from qiskit.transpiler.preset_passmanagers import generate_preset_pass_manager
       from qiskit.providers.fake_provider import FakeSherbrooke

       backend = FakeSherbrooke()
       pm = generate_preset_pass_manager(3, backend)
       staged_pass_manager_drawer(pm)

    The :meth:`.StagedPassManager.draw` method has been updated to include
    visualization of the stages in addition to the overall pass manager. The
    stages are represented by outer boxes in the visualization. In previous
    releases the stages were not included in the visualization. For example::

       from qiskit.transpiler.preset_passmanagers import generate_preset_pass_manager
       from qiskit.providers.fake_provider import FakeSherbrooke

       backend = FakeSherbrooke()
       pm = generate_preset_pass_manager(3, backend)
       pm.draw(pm)
