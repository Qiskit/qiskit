    The :class:`~qiskit.providers.options.Options` class now implements the
    the ``Mapping`` protocol and ``__setitem__`` method. This means that
    :class:`~.Options` instances now offer the same interface as standard
    dictionaries, except for the deletion methods (`__delitem__`, `pop`,
    `clear`). Key assignments are validated by the validators,
    if any are registered.
