    Fixed a bug in :meth:`.TensoredOp.to_matrix` where the global coefficient of the operator
    was multiplied to the final matrix more than once. Now, the global coefficient is correctly
    applied, independent of the number of tensored operators or states.
    Fixed `#9398 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/9398>`__.
