    Added a new function :func:`~.passmanager_stage_plugins` to the
    :mod:`qiskit.transpiler.preset_passmanagers.plugin` module. This function
    is used to obtain a mapping from plugin names to their their class type.
    This enables identifying and querying any defined pass manager stage plugin's
    documentation. For example::

        >>> from qiskit.transpiler.preset_passmanagers.plugin import passmanager_stage_plugins
        >>> passmanager_stage_plugins('routing')['lookahead'].__class__

        qiskit.transpiler.preset_passmanagers.builtin_plugins.LookaheadSwapPassManager

        >>> help(passmanager_stage_plugins('routing')['lookahead'])
        Help on BasicSwapPassManager in module qiskit.transpiler.preset_passmanagers.builtin_plugins object:

        class BasicSwapPassManager(qiskit.transpiler.preset_passmanagers.plugin.PassManagerStagePlugin)
        |  Plugin class for routing stage with :class:`~.BasicSwap`
        ...
