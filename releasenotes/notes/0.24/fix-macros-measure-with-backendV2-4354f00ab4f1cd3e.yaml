    Fixed an issue when using the :mod:`~qiskit.pulse` macro
    :func:`~qiskit.pulse.macros.measure` when working with a
    :class:`.BackendV2` based backend. Previously, trying to use
    :func:`qiskit.pulse.macros.measure` with a :class:`.BackendV2`
    based backend would have resulted in an error.
    Fixed `#9488 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/9488>`__
