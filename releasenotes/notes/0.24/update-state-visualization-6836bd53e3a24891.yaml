features:
  - |
    The ``figsize`` argument of
    :obj:`~qiskit.visualization.plot_bloch_multivector` can now be used to
    set a size for individual Bloch ball sub-plots: if there are ``num``
    qubits and ``(w, h)`` is passed to ``figsize``, then the overall figure
    width is set to ``num*w``, while the overall height is set to ``h``.
  - |
    A new ``font_size`` keyword argument for
    :obj:`~qiskit.visualization.plot_bloch_multivector` can be used to
    control the font size in Bloch ball sub-plots.
  - |
    New ``title_font_size`` and ``title_pad`` keyword arguments
    for :obj:`~qiskit.visualization.plot_bloch_multivector` can be used to
    control the font size of the overall title and its padding.
fixes:
  - |
    Previous to this release, the ``figsize`` argument of
    :obj:`~qiskit.visualization.plot_bloch_multivector` was not used by the
    visualization, making it impossible to change its size (e.g. to shrink
    it for single-qubit states). This release fixes it by introducing a use
    for the ``figsize`` argument.
