    Added a new keyword argument, ``figsize``, to the
    :func:`~qiskit.visualization.plot_bloch_multivector` function. This
    argument can be used to set a size for individual Bloch sphere sub-plots.
    For example, if there are :math:`n` qubits and ``figsize`` is set to
    ``(w, h)``, then the overall figure width is set to :math:`n \cdot w`, while the
    overall height is set to :math:`h`.

    Added a new keyword argument, ``font_size``, to the
    :func:`~qiskit.visualization.plot_bloch_multivector` function. This argument
    can be used to control the font size in the output visualization.
  - |
    Added two new keyword arguments, ``title_font_size`` and ``title_pad``, to
    the :func:`~qiskit.visualization.plot_bloch_multivector` function. These
    arguments can be used to control the font size of the overall title and its
    padding respectively.
fixes:
  - |
    Previous to this release, the ``figsize`` argument of
    :func:`~qiskit.visualization.plot_bloch_multivector` was not used by the
    visualization, making it impossible to change its size (e.g. to shrink
    it for single-qubit states). This release fixes it by introducing a use
    for the ``figsize`` argument.
