    Added a new attribute :attr:`~qiskit.algorithms.minimum_eigensolvers.AdaptVQE.eigenvalue_threshold`
    to the :class:`~qiskit.algorithms.minimum_eigensolvers.AdaptVQE` class for
    configuring a new kind of threshold to terminate the algorithm once
    the eigenvalue changes less than a set value.

    Added a new attribute :attr:`~qiskit.algorithms.minimum_eigensolvers.AdaptVQE.gradient_threshold`
    to the :class:`~qiskit.algorithms.minimum_eigensolvers.AdaptVQE` class
    which will replace the :attr:`~qiskit.algorithms.minimum_eigensolvers.AdaptVQE.threshold` in the
    future. This new attribute behaves the same as the existing ``threshold`` attribute but has a more
    accurate name, given the introduction of additional threshold options
    in the class.
