    The runtime performance of the :class:`~.Optimize1qGatesDecomposition`
    transpiler pass has been significantly improved. This was done by both
    rewriting all the computation for the pass in Rust and also decreasing
    the amount of intermediate objects created as part of the pass's
    execution. This should also correspond to a similar improvement
    in the runtime performance of :func:`~.transpile` with the
    ``optimization_level`` keyword argument set to ``1``, ``2``, or ``3``.
