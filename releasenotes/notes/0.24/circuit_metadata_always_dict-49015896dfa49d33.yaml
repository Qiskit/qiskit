upgrade:
  - |
    The :class:`.QuantumCircuit` :attr:`.QuantumCircuit.metadata` attribute now
    always returns a dictionary, and can only be set to a dictionary. Previously, 
    its default value was ``None``, and could be manually set to ``None`` or a 
    dictionary.
  - |
    The default value of ``metadata`` in both :class:`.DAGCircuit` and 
    :class:`.DAGDependency` has been changed from ``None`` to ``{}`` for compatibility
    with a similar attribute of :class:`.QuantumCircuit`.
deprecations:
  - |
    Setting the :class:`.QuantumCircuit` :attr:`.QuantumCircuit.metadata` attribute 
    to ``None`` has been deprecated. Instead, users should set it to an empty 
    dictionary if they want it to contain no data.
