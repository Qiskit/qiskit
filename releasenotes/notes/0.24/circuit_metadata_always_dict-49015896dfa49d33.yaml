upgrade_circuits:
  - |
    The :class:`.QuantumCircuit` :attr:`~.QuantumCircuit.metadata` attribute now
    always returns a dictionary, and can only be set to a dictionary. Previously,
    its default value was ``None``, and could be manually set to ``None`` or a
    dictionary.
upgrade_transpiler:
  - |
    The default value of ``metadata`` in both :class:`.DAGCircuit` and
    :class:`.DAGDependency` has been changed from ``None`` to ``{}`` for compatibility
    with the matching ``metadata`` attribute of :class:`.QuantumCircuit`.
deprecations_circuits:
  - |
    Setting the :class:`.QuantumCircuit` :attr:`~.QuantumCircuit.metadata` attribute
    to ``None`` has been deprecated and will no longer be supported in a future
    release. Instead, users should set it to an empty dictionary if they want
    it to contain no data.
