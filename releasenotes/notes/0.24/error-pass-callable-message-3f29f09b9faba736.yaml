    The transpiler pass :class:`~.Error` now also accepts callable
    inputs for its ``msg`` parameter. If used these input callables will be passed
    the ``property_set`` attribute of the pass and are expected to return a string
    which will be used for the error message when the pass is run. For example::

        from qiskit.transpiler.passes import Error

        def error_message(property_set):

            size = property_set["size']
            return f"The circuit size is: {size}"

        error_pass = Error(error_message)

    When ``error_pass`` is included in a pass manager it will error using the
    message ``"The circuit size is: n"`` where ``n`` is the circuit size set
    in the property set (typically from the previous execution of the
    :class:`~.Size` pass).
