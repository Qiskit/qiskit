    Added new :class:`~.SymbolicPulse` classes to the pulse library (:mod:`qiskit.pulse.library`)
    The new pulses in the library are:

      * :class:`~qiskit.pulse.library.Sin`
      * :class:`~qiskit.pulse.library.Cos`
      * :class:`~qiskit.pulse.library.Sawtooth`
      * :class:`~qiskit.pulse.library.Triangle`

    These new classes are instances of :class:`~.ScalableSymbolicPulse`. With the exception of
    the :class:`~.Sawtooth` phase, behavior is identical to that of the corresponding waveform generator
    function (e.g. :func:`~qiskit.pulse.library.sin`). The phase for the :class:`~.Sawtooth` class
    is defined such that a phase of :math:`2\pi` shifts by a full cycle.
