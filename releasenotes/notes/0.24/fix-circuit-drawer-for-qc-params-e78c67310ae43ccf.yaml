    Fixed an issue with the circuit drawer function :func:`~.circuit_drawer` and
    :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.draw` method when displaying instruction parameters
    that type :class:`.QuantumCircuit` which would result in an illegible
    drawing.
    Fixed `#9908 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/9908>`__
