    Fixed an issue in the :func:`~.state_to_latex` function where it would
    potentially produce invalid LaTeX due to unintended coefficient rounding.
    This could also result in errors when the :func:`~.state_drawer` was called.
    Fixed `#9297 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/9297>`__.
