    Added a new option, ``copy_operations``, to :func:`~.circuit_to_dag` to
    enable optionally disabling deep copying the operations from the input
    :class`~.QuantumCircuit` to the output :class:`~.QuantumCircuit`. In cases
    where the input :class`~.QuantumCircuit` is not used anymore after
    conversion this deep copying is unnecessary overhead as any shared
    references wouldn't have any potential unwanted side effects if the input
    :class`~.QuantumCircuit` is discarded.
