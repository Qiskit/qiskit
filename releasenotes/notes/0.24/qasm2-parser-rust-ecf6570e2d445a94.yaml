    A new OpenQASM 2 parser is available in :mod:`qiskit.qasm2`.  This has two entry points:
    :func:`.qasm2.load` and :func:`.qasm2.loads`, for reading the source code from a file and from a
    string, respectively::

      import qiskit.qasm2
      program = """
        OPENQASM 2.0;
        include "qelib1.inc";
        qreg q[2];
        h q[0];
        cx q[0], q[1];
      """
      bell = qiskit.qasm2.loads(program)

    This new parser is approximately 10x faster than the existing ones at
    :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.from_qasm_file` and :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.from_qasm_str` for large files,
    and has less overhead on each call as well.  The new parser is more extensible, customizable and
    generally also more type-safe; it will not attempt to output custom Qiskit objects when the
    definition in the OpenQASM 2 file clashes with the Qiskit object, unlike the current exporter.
    See the :mod:`qiskit.qasm2` module documentation for full details and more examples.
