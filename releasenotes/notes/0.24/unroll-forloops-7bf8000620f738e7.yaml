    Added a new transpiler pass, :class:`~.UnrollForLoops`, which is used
    to unroll any :class:`~.ForLoopOp` operations in a circuit. This pass
    unrolls for-loops when possible, if there are no
    :class:`~.ContinueLoopOp` or :class:`~.BreakLoopOp` inside the body
    block of the loop. For example:

    .. plot::
       :include-source:

       from qiskit.transpiler.passes import UnrollForLoops
       from qiskit import QuantumCircuit

       unroll_pass = UnrollForLoops()

       qc = QuantumCircuit(1)
       # For loop over range 5
       with qc.for_loop(range(5)) as i:
           qc.rx(i, 0)
       # Unroll loop into 5 rx gates
       unroll_pass(qc).draw("mpl")
