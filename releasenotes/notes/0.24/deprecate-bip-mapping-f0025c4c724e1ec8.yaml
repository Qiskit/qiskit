deprecations:

    The transpiler routing pass, :class:`~.BIPMapping` has been deprecated
    and will be removed in a future release. It has been replaced by an external
    plugin package: ``qiskit-bip-mapper``. Details for this new package can
    be found at the package's github repository:

    https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-bip-mapper

    The pass was made into a separate plugin package for two reasons, first
    the dependency on CPLEX makes it harder to use and secondly the plugin
    package more cleanly integrates with :func:`~.transpile`.
