    The maximum number of trials evaluated when searching for the best
    layout using :class:`.VF2Layout` and :class:`.VF2PostLayout` is now
    limited in
    :func:`~qiskit.transpiler.preset_passmanagers.level_1_pass_manager`,
    :func:`~qiskit.transpiler.preset_passmanagers.level_2_pass_manager`,
    and
    :func:`~qiskit.transpiler.preset_passmanagers.level_3_pass_manager`
    to ``2 500``, ``25 000``, and ``250 000``, respectively. Previously,
    all found possible layouts were evaluated. This change was made to prevent
    transpilation from hanging during layout scoring for circuits with many
    connected components on larger devices, which scales combinatorially
    since each connected component would be evaluated in all possible
    positions on the device. To perform a full search as
    before, manually run :class:`.VF2PostLayout` over the transpiled circuit
    in strict mode, specifying ``0`` for ``max_trials``.

    Fixed a performance scaling issue with the :class:`~.VF2Layout`
    and :class:`~.VF2PostLayout` passes in the preset pass managers and
    :func:`~.transpile`, which would occur when transpiling circuits with many
    connected components on large devices. Now the transpiler passes set
    upper bounds on the number of potential layouts that will be evaluated.
