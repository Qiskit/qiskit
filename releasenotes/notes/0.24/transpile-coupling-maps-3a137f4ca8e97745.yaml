    An issue that prevented :func:`~qiskit.transpile` from working when passed
    a list of :class:`~qiskit.transpiler.CouplingMap` objects was fixed. Note
    that passing such a list of coupling maps is deprecated and will not be
    possible starting with Qiskit Terra 0.25. Fixes
    `#9885 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/9885>`_.
