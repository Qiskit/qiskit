    The return type of `qiskit.transpiler.passmanager.PassManager.run` is now
    always the same as that of its first argument. Passing a single circuit
    returns a single circuit, passing a list of circuits, even of length 1,
    returns a list of circuits.
    See `#9798 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/9798>`.
