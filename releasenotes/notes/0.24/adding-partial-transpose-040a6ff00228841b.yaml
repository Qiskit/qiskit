    Added a new method, :meth:`~.DensityMatrix.partial_transpose`, to the
    :mod:`qiskit.quantum_info` module's :class:`~.DensityMatrix` class. This
    method is used to compute partial transposition of a density matrix,
    which is necessary for detecting entanglement between bipartite quantum
    systems.
