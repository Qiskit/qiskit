    The :class:`.GateDirection` transpiler pass can now correctly handle
    :class:`~.SwapGate` instances that may be present in the circuit when
    executing on a circuit. In these cases if the swap gate's qubit arguments
    are on the non-native direction of an edge, the pass will flip the argument
    order.
