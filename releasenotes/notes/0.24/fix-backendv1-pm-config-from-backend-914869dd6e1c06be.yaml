    Fixed an issue with the :meth:`.PassManagerConfig.from_backend`
    constructor method when it was used with a :class:`~.BackendV1` based
    simulator backend. For some simulator backends which did not populate
    some optional fields the constructor would error.
    Fixed `#9265 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/9265>`__ and
    `#8546 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/8546>`__
