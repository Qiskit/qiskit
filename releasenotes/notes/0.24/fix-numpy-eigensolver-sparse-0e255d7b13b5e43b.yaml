    Fixed a bug in the NumPy-based eigensolvers 
    (:class:`~.minimum_eigensolvers.NumPyMinimumEigensolver` / 
    :class:`~.eigensolvers.NumPyEigensolver`)
    and in the SciPy-based time evolvers (:class:`.SciPyRealEvolver` / 
    :class:`.SciPyImaginaryEvolver`), where operators that support conversion
    to sparse matrices, such as :class:`.SparsePauliOp`, were converted to dense matrices anyways.
