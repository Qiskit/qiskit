    Added support for handling time-dependent Hamiltonians (i.e. singly
    parametrized operators) to the
    :class:`~qiskit.algorithms.time_evolvers.trotterization.TrotterQRTE` class.
    To facilitate working with this the
    :attr:`~qiskit.algorithms.time_evolvers.trotterization.TrotterQRTE.num_timestamps`
    attribute and a matching keyword argument to the
    :class:`~qiskit.algorithms.time_evolvers.trotterization.TrotterQRTE`
    constructor to control the number of time steps to divide the full evolution
    into.
  - |
    Added support for evaluating observable evaluations at every time-step
    during the execution of the
    :class:`~qiskit.algorithms.time_evolvers.trotterization.TrotterQRTE` class. The
    :attr:`.TimeEvolutionProblem.aux_operators` is evaluated at every time
    step if the :attr:`.ProductFormula.reps`  attribute of the input
    ``product_formula`` argument in the constructor is set to 1.
