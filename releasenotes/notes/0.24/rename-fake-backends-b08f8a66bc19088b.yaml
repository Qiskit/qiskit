    The :attr:`~.BackendV2.name` attribute on the :class:`~.BackendV2` based
    fake backend classes in :mod:`qiskit.providers.fake_provider` have changed
    from earlier releases. Previously, the names had a suffix ``"_v2"`` to
    differentiate the class from the :class:`~.BackendV1` version. This suffix
    has been removed as having the suffix could lead to inconsistencies with
    other snapshotted data used to construct the backend object.
