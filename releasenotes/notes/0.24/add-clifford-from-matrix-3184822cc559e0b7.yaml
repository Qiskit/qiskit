    Added two new constructor methods, :meth:`.Clifford.from_matrix` and
    :meth:`.Clifford.from_operator`, that create a :class:`~.Clifford` object
    from its unitary matrix and operator representation respectively.
  - |
    The constructor of :class:`.Clifford` now can take any Clifford gate object
    up to 3 qubits as long it implements a ``to_matrix`` method,
    including parameterized gates such as ``Rz(pi/2)``, which were not
    convertible before.
