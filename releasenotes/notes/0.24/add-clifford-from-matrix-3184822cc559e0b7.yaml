features:
  - |
    Added :meth:`.Clifford.from_matrix` and :meth:`.Clifford.from_operator` method that
    creates a ``Clifford`` object from its unitary matrix and operator representation respectively.
  - |
    The constructor of :class:`.Clifford` now can take any Clifford gate object up to 3 qubits
    as long it supports :meth:`to_matrix` method,
    including parameterized gates such as ``Rz(pi/2)``, which were not convertible before.
