    Added extensions to the :class:`~.eigensolvers.VQD` algorithm, which allow
    to pass a list of optimizers and initial points for the different
    minimization runs. For example, the ``k``-th initial point and 
    ``k``-th optimizer will be used for the optimization of the
    ``k-1``-th exicted state.
