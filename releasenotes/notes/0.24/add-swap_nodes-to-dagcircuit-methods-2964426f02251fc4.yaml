    Added a new method, :meth:`~.DAGCircuit.swap_node`, to the
    :class:`~.DAGCircuit` to allow swapping nodes which are partially
    connected. Partially connected here means that the two nodes share at
    least one edge (which represents a qubit or clbit). If the nodes do not
    share any edges a :class:`~.DAGCircuitError` is raised.
