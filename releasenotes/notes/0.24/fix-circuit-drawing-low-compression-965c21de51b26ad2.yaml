    Fixed an issue with the circuit drawer function :func:`~.circuit_drawer`
    and :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.draw` method when using the ``text`` method and
    the argument ``vertical_compression="low"`` where it would use an incorrect
    character for the  top-right corner of boxes used to represent gates
    in the circuit.
