    Added the method :class:`.StabilizerState.equiv`,
    that checks if the generating sets of two stabilizer states generate the same stabilizer group.
    For example, the stabilizer group of the two-qubit Bell state contains the four elements
    :math:`\{II, XX, -YY, ZZ\}` and hence can be generated by either :math:`[XX, ZZ]`,
    :math:`[XX, -YY]` or :math:`[-YY, ZZ]`.
