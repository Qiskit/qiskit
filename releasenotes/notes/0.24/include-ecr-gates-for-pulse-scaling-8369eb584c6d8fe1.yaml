    This PR now allows the pulse scaling techniques found in RZXCalibrationBuilder
    and RZXCalibrationBuilderNoEcho to consume `ecr` entangling gates from the
    backend, in addition to the `cx` gates they were build for. These native gates
    contain the calibrated pulse schedules that the pulse scaling passes use to 
    generate arbitrary rotations of the :class:`~RZXGate` operation.
