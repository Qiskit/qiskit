    The :class:`~.RZXCalibrationBuilder` and :class:`~.RZXCalibrationBuilderNoEcho` transpiler passes now will correctly use
    an :class:`~.ECRGate` for the entangling gate if the backend's native
    entangling gate is :class:`~.ECRGate`. Previously, the passes would only
    function correctly if the entangling gate was :class:`~.CXGate`.
