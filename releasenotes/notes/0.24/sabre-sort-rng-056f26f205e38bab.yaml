    Internal tweaks to the routing algorithm in :class:`.SabreSwap`, used in
    transpilation of non-dynamic circuits at all non-zero optimization levels,
    have sped up routing for very large circuits.  For example, the time to
    route a depth-5 :class:`.QuantumVolume` circuit for a 1081-qubit heavy-hex
    coupling map is approximately halved.

    The result of transpilations for fixed seeds may have changed compared to
    previous versions of Qiskit Terra.  This is because of internal tweaks to
    the routing algorithm used by :class:`.SabreSwap` and :class:`.SabreLayout`,
    which are the default routing and layout passes respectively, to make them
    significantly faster for large circuits.
