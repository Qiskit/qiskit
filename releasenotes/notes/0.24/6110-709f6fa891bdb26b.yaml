    The previously deprecated ``condition`` attribute of the
    :class:`~.DAGDepNode` class has been removed. It was marked as deprecated
    in the 0.18 release (07-2021). Instead you should use the
    :attr:`~.Instruction.condition` attribute of the ``op`` attribute to
    access the condition of an operation node. For other node types there
    is no condition to access.
