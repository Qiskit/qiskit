fixes:
  - |
    The :attr:`~qiskit.circuit.Register.name` setter method of class
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.Register` (which is the parent class of
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumRegister` and
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.ClassicalRegister`) previously did not check if
    the assigned string was a valid register name as per the  
    `OpenQASM specification <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.03429v2.pdf>`__. 
    This check was previously only performed when the name was specified in the
    constructor, this has now been fixed so that setting the ``name``
    attribute directly with an invalid value will now also raise an
    exception.
    Fixed `#5461 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/5461>`__
