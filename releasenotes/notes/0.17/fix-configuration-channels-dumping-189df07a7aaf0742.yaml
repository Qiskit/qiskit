    Fixes a bug where the ``channels`` field for a
    :class:`~qiskit.providers.models.PulseBackendConfiguration` object was
    not being included in the output of the
    :class:`qiskit.providers.models.PulseBackendConfiguration.to_dict` method.
    Fixed `#5579 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/5579>`__
