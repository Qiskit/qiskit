    Following transpilation of a parameterized
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit`, the
    :attr:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.global_phase` attribute of output
    circuit may no longer be returned in a simplified form, if the global phase
    is a :class:`~qiskit.circuit.ParameterExpression`.

    For example::

      qc = QuantumCircuit(1)
      theta = Parameter('theta')

      qc.rz(theta, 0)
      qc.rz(-theta, 0)

      print(transpile(qc, basis_gates=['p']).global_phase)

    previously returned ``0``, but will now return ``-0.5*theta + 0.5*theta``.
    This change was necessary was to avoid a large runtime performance
    penalty as simplifying symbolic expressions can be quite slow, especially
    if there are many :class:`~qiskit.circuit.ParameterExpression` objects
    in a circuit.
