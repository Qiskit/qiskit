    The :func:`~qiskit.quantum_info.decompose_clifford` function in the
    :mod:`~qiskit.quantum_info` module (which gets used internally by the
    :meth:`qiskit.quantum_info.Clifford.to_circuit` method) has a new kwarg
    ``method`` which enables selecting the synthesis method used by either
    setting it to ``'AG'`` or ``'greedy'``. By default for more than three
    qubits it is set to ``'greedy'`` which uses a non-optimal greedy compilation
    routine for Clifford elements synthesis, by Bravyi et. al., which typically
    yields better CX cost compared to the previously used Aaronson-Gottesman
    method (for more than two qubits). You can use the ``method`` kwarg to revert
    to the previous default Aaronson-Gottesman method by setting ``method='AG'``.

    The default synthesis method used by
    :func:`~qiskit.quantum_info.decompose_clifford` function in the
    :mod:`~qiskit.quantum_info` module (which gets used internally by the
    :meth:`qiskit.quantum_info.Clifford.to_circuit` method) for more than
    3 qubits now uses a non-optimal greedy compilation routine for Clifford
    elements synthesis, by Bravyi et. al., which typically yields better CX
    cost compared to the old default. If you need to revert to the previous
    Aaronson-Gottesman method this can be done by setting ``method='AG'``.
