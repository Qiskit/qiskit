features:
  - |
    A new a new 2-qubit gate, :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.ECRGate`,
    the echo cross-resonance (ECR), has been added to the
    :mod:`qiskit.circuit.library` module along with a corresponding method,
    :meth:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.ecr` for the
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit` class. The ECR gate is two
    :math:`CR(\frac{Ï€,4})` pulses with an
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.XGate` between them for the echo. This gate
    is locally equivalent to a :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.CXGate` (can
    convert to a CNOT with local pre- or post-rotation). It is the native gate
    on current IBM hardware and compiling to it allows the pre-/post-rotations
    to be merged into the rest of the circuit.
  - |
    A new kwarg ``approximation_degree`` has been added to the
    :func:`~qiskit.compiler.transpile` function for enabling
    approximate compilation. Valid values range from 0 to 1, and higher
    means less approximation. This is a heuristic dial
    to experiment with circuit approximations. The concrete interpretation
    of this number is left to each pass, which may use it to perform
    some approximate version of the pass. Specific examples include
    unitary synthesis or translators to discrete gate sets.
    If a pass does not support this option, it implies exact transformation.
  - |
    Two new transpiler passess, :class:`~qiskit.transpiler.GateDirection` and
    class:`qiskit.transpiler.CheckGateDirection`, were added to the
    :mod:`qiskit.transpiler.passes` module. These new passes are inteded to
    be more general replacements for
    :class:`~qiskit.transpiler.passes.CXDirection` and
    :class:`~qiskit.transpiler.passes.CheckCXDirection` (which are both now
    deprecated, see the deprecation notes for more details) that perform the
    same function but work with other gates beside just
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.CXGate`.
deprecations:
  - |
    The :class:`~qiskit.transpiler.passes.CXDirection` transpiler pass in the
    :mod:`qiskit.transpiler.passes` module has been deprecated and will be
    removed in a future release. Instead the
    :class:`~qiskit.transpiler.GateDirection` should be used. It behaves
    identically to the :class:`~qiskit.transpiler.passes.CXDirection` except
    that it now also supports transforming a circuit with
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.ECRGate` gates in addition to
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.CXGate` gates.
  - |
    The :class:`~qiskit.transpiler.passes.CheckCXDirection` transpiler pass in
    the :mod:`qiskit.transpiler.passes` module has been deprecated and will be
    removed in a future release. Instead the
    :class:`~qiskit.transpiler.CheckGateDirection` pass should be used.
    It behaves identically to the
    :class:`~qiskit.transpiler.passes.CheckCXDirection` except
    that it now also supports checking the direction of all 2-qubit gates, not
    just :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.CXGate` gates.
