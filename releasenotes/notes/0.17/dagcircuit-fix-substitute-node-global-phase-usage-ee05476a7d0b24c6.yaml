    The ``DAGCircuit.__eq__`` method (which is used by the ``==`` operator),
    which is used to check structural equality of
    :class:`~qiskit.dagcircuit.DAGCircuit` and
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit` instances, will now
    include the :attr:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.global_phase` and
    :attr:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.calibrations` attributes in the
    fields checked for equality. This means that circuits which would have
    evaluated as equal in prior releases may not anymore if the
    ``global_phase`` or ``calibrations`` differ between the circuits. For
    example, in previous releases this would return ``True``::

      import math

      from qiskit import QuantumCircuit

      qc1 = QuantumCircuit(1)
      qc1.x(0)

      qc2 = QuantumCircuit(1, global_phase=math.pi)
      qc2.x(0)

      print(qc2 == qc1)

    However, now because the ``global_phase`` attribute of the circuits differ
    this will now return ``False``.
