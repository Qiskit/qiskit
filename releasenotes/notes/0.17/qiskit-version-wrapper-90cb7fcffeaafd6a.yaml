    The ``qiskit.__qiskit_version__`` module attribute was previously a ``dict``
    will now return a custom read-only ``Mapping`` object that checks the
    version of qiskit elements at runtime instead of at import time. This was
    done to speed up the import path of qiskit and eliminate a possible import
    cycle by only importing the element packages at runtime if the version
    is needed from the package. This should be fully compatible with the
    ``dict`` previously return and for most normal use cases there will be no
    difference. However, if some applications were relying on either mutating
    the contents or explicitly type checking it may require updates to adapt to
    this change.

    The ``qiskit.execute`` module has been renamed to
    :mod:`qiskit.execute_function`. This was necessary to avoid a potential
    name conflict between the :func:`~qiskit.execute_function.execute` function
    which is re-exported as ``qiskit.execute``. ``qiskit.execute`` the function
    in some situations could conflict with ``qiskit.execute`` the module which
    would lead to a cryptic error because Python was treating ``qiskit.execute``
    as the module when the intent was to the function or vice versa. The module
    rename was necessary to avoid this conflict. If you're importing
    ``qiskit.execute`` to get the module (typical usage was
    ``from qiskit.execute import execute``) you will need to update this to
    use ``qiskit.execute_function`` instead. ``qiskit.execute`` will now always
    resolve to the function.

    The ``qiskit.compiler.transpile``, ``qiskit.compiler.assemble``,
    ``qiskit.compiler.schedule``, and ``qiskit.compiler.sequence`` modules have
    been renamed to ``qiskit.compiler.transpiler``,
    ``qiskit.compiler.assembler``, ``qiskit.compiler.scheduler``, and
    ``qiskit.compiler.sequence`` respectively. This was necessary to avoid a
    potential name conflict between the modules and the re-exported function
    paths :func:`qiskit.compiler.transpile`, :func:`qiskit.compiler.assemble`,
    :func:`qiskit.compiler.schedule`, and :func:`qiskit.compiler.sequence`.
    In some situations this name conflict between the module path and
    re-exported function path would lead to a cryptic error because Python was
    treating an import as the module when the intent was to use the function or
    vice versa. The module rename was necessary to avoid this conflict. If
    you were using the imports to get the modules before (typical usage would
    be like``from qiskit.compiler.transpile import transpile``) you will need
    to update this to use the new module paths.
    :func:`qiskit.compiler.transpile`, :func:`qiskit.compiler.assemble`,
    :func:`qiskit.compiler.schedule`, and :func:`qiskit.compiler.sequence`
    will now always resolve to the functions.
