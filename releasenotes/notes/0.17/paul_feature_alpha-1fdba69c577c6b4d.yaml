    The :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.PauliFeatureMap` class in the
    :mod:`qiskit.circuit.library` module now supports adjusting the rotational
    factor, :math:`\alpha`, by either setting using the kwarg ``alpha`` on
    the constructor or setting the
    :attr:`~qiskit.circuit.library.PauliFeatureMap.alpha` attribute after
    creation. Previously this value was fixed at ``2.0``. Adjusting this
    attribute allows for better control of decision boundaries and provides
    additional flexibility handling the input features without needing
    to explicitly scale them in the data set.
