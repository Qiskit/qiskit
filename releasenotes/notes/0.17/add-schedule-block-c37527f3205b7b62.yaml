features:

    A new class, :py:class:`~qiskit.pulse.ScheduleBlock`, has been added to
    the :class:`qiskit.pulse` module. This class provides a new representation
    of a pulse program. This representation is best suited for the pulse
    builder syntax and is based on relative instruction ordering.

    This representation takes ``alignment_context`` instead of specifying
    starting time ``t0`` for each instruction. The start time of instruction is
    implicitly allocated with the specified transformation and relative
    position of instructions.

    The :py:class:`~qiskit.pulse.ScheduleBlock` allows for lazy instruction
    scheduling, meaning we can assign arbitrary parameters to the duration of
    instructions.

    For example:

    .. code-block:: python

        from qiskit.pulse import ScheduleBlock, DriveChannel, Gaussian
        from qiskit.pulse.instructions import Play, Call
        from qiskit.pulse.transforms import AlignRight
        from qiskit.circuit import Parameter

        dur = Parameter('rabi_duration')

        block = ScheduleBlock(alignment_context=AlignRight())
        block += Play(Gaussian(dur, 0.1, dur/4), DriveChannel(0))
        block += Call(measure_sched)  # subroutine defined elsewhere

    this code defines an experiment scanning a Gaussian pulse's duration
    followed by a measurement ``measure_sched``, i.e. a Rabi experiment.
    You can reuse the ``block`` object for every scanned duration
    by assigning a target duration value.
deprecations:
  - |
    The :meth:`~qiskit.pulse.channels.Channel.assign_parameters` for the
    following classes:

     * :py:class:`qiskit.pulse.channels.Channel`,
     * :py:class:`qiskit.pulse.library.Pulse`,
     * :py:class:`qiskit.pulse.instructions.Instruction`,

    and all their subclasses is now deprecated and will be removed in a future
    release. This functionality has been subsumed
    :py:class:`~qiskit.pulse.ScheduleBlock` which is the future direction for
    constructing parameterized pulse programs.
  - |
    The :attr:`~qiskit.pulse.channels.Channel.parameters` attribute for
    the following classes:

      * :py:class:`~qiskit.pulse.channels.Channel`
      * :py:class:`~qiskit.pulse.instructions.Instruction`.

    is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. This functionality
    has been subsumed :py:class:`~qiskit.pulse.ScheduleBlock` which is the
    future direction for constructing parameterized pulse programs.
