features:

    The user config file has 2 new configuration options, ``num_processes`` and
    ``parallel``, which are used to control the default behavior of
    :func:`~qiskit.tools.parallel_map`. The ``parallel`` option is a boolean
    that is used to dictate whether :func:`~qiskit.tools.parallel_map` will
    run in multiple processes or not. If it set to ``False`` calls to
    :func:`~qiskit.tools.parallel_map` will be executed serially, while setting
    it to ``True`` will enable parallel execution. The ``num_processes`` option
    takes an integer which sets how many CPUs to use when executing in parallel.
    By default it will use the number of CPU cores on a system.

    There are 2 new environment variables, ``QISKIT_PARALLEL`` and
    ``QISKIT_NUM_PROCS``, that can be used to control the default behavior of
    :func:`~qiskit.tools.parallel_map`. The ``QISKIT_PARALLEL`` option can be
    set to the ``TRUE`` (any capitalization) to set the default to run in
    multiple processes when :func:`~qiskit.tools.parallel_map` is called. If it
    is set to any other
    value :func:`~qiskit.tools.parallel_map` will be executed serially.
    ``QISKIT_NUM_PROCS`` takes an integer (for example ``QISKIT_NUM_PROCS=5``)
    which will be used as the default number of processes to run with. Both
    of these will take precedence over the equivalent option set in the user
    config file.
upgrade:
  - |
    By default on macOS with Python >=3.8 :func:`~qiskit.tools.parallel_map`
    will no longer run in multiple processes. This is a change from previous
    releases where the default behavior was that
    :func:`~qiskit.tools.parallel_map` would launch multiple processes. This
    change was made because with newer versions of macOS with Python 3.8 and
    3.9 multiprocessing is either unreliable or adds significant overhead
    because of the change in Python 3.8 to launch new processes with ``spawn``
    instead of ``fork``. To re-enable parallel execution on macOS with
    Python >= 3.8 you can use the user config file ``parallel`` option or set
    the environment variable ``QISKIT_PARALLEL`` to ``True``.
