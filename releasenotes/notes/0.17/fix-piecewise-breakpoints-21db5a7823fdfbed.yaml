    Fixed the handling of breakpoints in the
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.PiecewisePolynomialPauliRotations` class
    in the :mod:`qiskit.circuit.library`. Now for ``n`` intervals,
    ``n+1`` breakpoints are allowed. This enables specifying another end
    interval other than :math:`2^\text{num qubits}`. This is important because
    from the end of the last interval to :math:`2^\text{num qubits}` the function
    is the identity.
