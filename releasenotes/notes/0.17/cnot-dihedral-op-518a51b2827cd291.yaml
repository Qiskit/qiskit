    Add a new operator class :class:`~qiskit.quantum_info.CNOTDihedral` has
    been added to the :mod:`qiskit.quantum_info` module. This class is
    used to represent the CNOT-Dihedral group, which is generated by the
    quantum gates :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.CXGate`,
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.TGate`,
    and :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.XGate`.
