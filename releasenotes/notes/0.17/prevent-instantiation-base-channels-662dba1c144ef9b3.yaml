    It is now no longer possible to instantiate a base channel without
    a prefix such as :class:`qiskit.pulse.Channel` or 
    :class:`qiskit.pulse.PulseChannel`. These classes are designed to be
    parent classes for different user facing channel classes, such
    as :class:`qiskit.pulse.DriveChannel`, and not something directly used.
    When instantiated directly they were not actually usable. If you were
    previously directly instantiate either :class:`qiskit.pulse.Channel` or
    :class:`qiskit.pulse.PulseChannel` this no longer works.
