deprecations:
  - |
    The :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.WeightedAdder` method
    :meth:`~qiskit.circuit.library.WeightedAdder.num_ancilla_qubits` is
    deprecated and will be removed in a future release. It has been replaced
    with the :attr:`qiskit.circuit.library.WeightedAdder.num_ancillas` attribute
    which is consistent with other circuit libraries' APIs.
fixes:
  - |
    Improved the allocation of helper qubits in
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.PolynomialPauliRotations` and
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.PiecewiseLinearPauliRotations` which makes
    the implementation of these circuit more efficient.
    Fixed `#5320 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/5320>`__ and
    `#5322 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/5322>`__
  - |
    Fix the usage of the allocated helper qubits in the
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.MCXGate` in the
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.WeightedAdder` class. These were previously
    allocated but not used prior to this fix.
    Fixed `#5321 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/5321>`__
