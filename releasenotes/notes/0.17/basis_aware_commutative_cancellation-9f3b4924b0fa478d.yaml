    The :class:`~qiskit.transpiler.passes.CommutativeCancellation` transpiler
    pass has a new optional kwarg on the constructor ``basis_gates``, which
    takes the a list of the names of basis gates for the target backend.
    When specified the pass will only use gates in the ``basis_gates`` kwarg.
    Previously, the pass would automatically replace consecutive gates which
    commute with :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.ZGate` with the
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.U1Gate` unconditionally. The ``basis_gates``
    kwarg enables you to specify which z-rotation gates are present in
    the target basis to avoid this.

    The :class:`~qiskit.transpiler.passes.CommutativeCancellation` transpiler
    pass is now aware of the target basis gates, which means it will only
    use gates in the specified basis. Previously, the pass would unconditionally
    replace consecutive gates which commute with
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.ZGate` with the
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.U1Gate`. However, now that the pass is
    basis aware and has a kwarg, ``basis_gates``, for specifying the target
    basis there is a potential change in behavior if the kwarg is not set.
    When the ``basis_gates`` kwarg is not used and there are no variable
    z-rotation gates in the circuit then no commutative cancellation will occur.
