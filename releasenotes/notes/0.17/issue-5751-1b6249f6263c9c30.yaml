    A new transpiler pass,
    :py:class:`qiskit.transpiler.passes.RZXCalibrationBuilder`, capable
    of generating calibrations and adding them to a quantum circuit has been
    introduced. This pass takes calibrated
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.CXGate` objects and creates the
    calibrations for :class:`qiskit.circuit.library.RZXGate` objects with an
    arbitrary rotation angle. The schedules are created by stretching and
    compressing the :class:`~qiskit.pulse.GaussianSquare` pulses of the
    echoed-cross resonance gates.

    New template circuits for using :class:`qiskit.circuit.library.RZXGate`
    are added to the :mod:`qiskit.circuit.library` module (eg
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.rzx_yz`). This enables pairing
    the :class:`~qiskit.transpiler.passes.TemplateOptimization` pass with the
    :py:class:`qiskit.transpiler.passes.RZXCalibrationBuilder` pass to
    automatically find and replace gate sequences, such as
    ``CNOT - P(theta) - CNOT``, with more efficient circuits based on
    :class:`qiskit.circuit.library.RZXGate` with a calibration.
