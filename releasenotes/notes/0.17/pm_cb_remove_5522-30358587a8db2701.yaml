    The previously deprecated kwarg ``callback`` on the constructor for the
    :class:`~qiskit.transpiler.PassManager` class has been removed. This
    kwarg has been deprecated since the 0.13.0 release (April, 9th 2020).
    Instead you can pass the ``callback`` kwarg to the
    :meth:`qiskit.transpiler.PassManager.run` method directly. For example,
    if you were using::

      from qiskit.circuit.random import random_circuit
      from qiskit.transpiler import PassManager

      qc = random_circuit(2, 2)

      def callback(**kwargs)
        print(kwargs['pass_'])

      pm = PassManager(callback=callback)
      pm.run(qc)

    this can be replaced with::

      from qiskit.circuit.random import random_circuit
      from qiskit.transpiler import PassManager

      qc = random_circuit(2, 2)

      def callback(**kwargs)
        print(kwargs['pass_'])

      pm = PassManager()
      pm.run(qc, callback=callback)
