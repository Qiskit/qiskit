    A new :class:`~qiskit.circuit.Gate` class,
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.PauliGate`, has been added
    the :class:`qiskit.circuit.library` module and corresponding method,
    :meth:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.pauli`,  was added to the
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit` class. This new gate class enables
    applying several individual pauli gates to different qubits at the
    simultaneously. This is primarily useful for simulators which can use this
    new gate to more efficiently implement multiple simultaneous Pauli gates.
