deprecations:
  - |
    The JSON Schema files and usage for the IBMQ API payloads are deprecated
    and will be removed in a future release. This includes everything under
    the :mod:`qiskit.schemas` module and the :mod:`qiskit.validation` module.
    This also includes the ``validate`` kwargs for
    :meth:`qiskit.qobj.QasmQobj.to_dict` and
    :meth:`qiskit.qobj.QasmQobj.to_dict` along with the module level
    fastjsonschema validators in :mod:`qiskit.qobj` (which do not raise a
    deprecation warning). The schema files have been moved
    to the `Qiskit/ibmq-schemas <https://github.com/Qiskit/ibmq-schemas>`__
    repository and those should be treated as the canonical versions of the
    API schemas. Moving forward only those schemas will receive updates and
    will be used as the source of truth for the schemas. If you were relying
    on the schemas bundled in qiskit-terra you should update to
    use that repository instead.
