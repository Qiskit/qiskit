    migrated and adapted from the :mod:`qiskit.aqua` project.

    A new module :mod:`qiskit.algorithms` has been introduced. This module
    contains functionality equivalent to what has previously been
    provided by the :mod:`qiskit.aqua.algorithms` module (which is now
    deprecated) and provides the building blocks for constructing quantum
    algorithms. For details on migrating from ``qiskit-aqua`` to this new
    module please refer to the migration guide "INSERT LINK HERE"

    A new module :mod:`qiskit.opflow` has been introduced. This module
    contains functionality equivalent to what has previously been
    provided by the :mod:`qiskit.aqua.operators` module (which is now
    deprecated) and provides the operators and state functions which are
    used to build quantum algorithms. For details on migrating from
    ``qiskit-aqua`` to this new module please refer to the migration guide

    This is the first release that includes precompiled binary wheels for
    the for Linux aarch64 systems. If you are running a manylinux2014
    compatible aarch64 Linux system there are now precompiled wheels available
    on PyPI, you are no longer required to build from source to install
    qiskit-terra.
