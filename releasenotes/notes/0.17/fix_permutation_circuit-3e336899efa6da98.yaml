    Fixed an issue in the :class:`qiskit.circuit.library.Permutation` circuit
    class where some permutations would not be properly generated. This issue
    could also effect :class:`qiskit.circuit.library.QuantumVolume` if it were
    called with `classical_permutation=False``.
    Fixed `#5812 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/5812>`__
