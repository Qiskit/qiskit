    Fixed an issue with the :func:`qiskit.visualization.timeline_drawer`
    function where classical bits were improperly handled.
    Fixed `#5361 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/5361>`__

    Fixed an issue in the :func:`qiskit.visualization.circuit_drawer` function
    and the :meth:`qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.draw` method where
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.Delay` instructions in a
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit` object were not being correctly
    treated as idle time. So when the ``idle_wires`` kwarg was set to
    ``False`` the wires with the :class:`~qiskit.circuit.Delay` objects would
    still be shown. This has been fixed so that the idle wires are removed from
    the visualization if there are only :class:`~qiskit.circuit.Delay` objects
    on a wire.
