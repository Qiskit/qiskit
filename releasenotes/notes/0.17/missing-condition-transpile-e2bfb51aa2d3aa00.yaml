upgrade:
  - |
    The previously deprecated ``condition`` kwarg for
    :class:`qiskit.dagcircuit.DAGNode` constructor has been removed.
    It was deprecated in the 0.15.0 release. Instead you should now be setting
    the classical condition on the :class:`~qiskit.circuit.Instruction` object
    passed into the :class:`~qiskit.dagcircuit.DAGNode` constructor when
    creating a new ``op`` node.
