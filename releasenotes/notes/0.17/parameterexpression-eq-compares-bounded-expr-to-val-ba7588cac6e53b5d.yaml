    The ``__eq__`` method (ie what is called when the ``==`` operator is used)
    for the :class:`~qiskit.circuit.ParameterExpression` now allows for the
    comparison with a numeric value. Previously, it was only possible
    to compare two instances of
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.ParameterExpression` with ``==``. For example::

        from qiskit.circuit import Parameter
  
        x = Parameter("x")
        y = x + 2
        y = y.assign(x, -1)

        assert y == 1
