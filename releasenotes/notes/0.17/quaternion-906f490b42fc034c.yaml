    The :class:`qiskit.quantum_info.Quaternion` class was moved from the
    ``qiskit.quantum_info.operator`` submodule to the 
    ``qiskit.quantum_info.synthesis`` submodule to better reflect it's purpose.
    No change is required if you were importing it from the root
    :mod:`qiskit.quantum_info` module, but if you were importing from
    ``qiskit.quantum_info.operator`` you will need to update your import path.
