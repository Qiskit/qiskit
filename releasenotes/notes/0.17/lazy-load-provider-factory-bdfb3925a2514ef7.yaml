    The ``qiskit.Aer`` and ``qiskit.IBMQ`` top level attributes are now lazy
    loaded. This means that the objects will now always exist and warnings will
    no longer be raised on import if ``qiskit-aer`` or ``qiskit-ibmq-provider``
    are not installed (or can't be found by Python). If you were checking for
    the presence of ``qiskit-aer`` or ``qiskit-ibmq-provider`` using these
    module attributes and explicitly comparing to ``None`` or looking for the
    absence of the attribute this no longer will work because they are always
    defined as an object now. In other words running something like::

        try:
            from qiskit import Aer
        except ImportError:
            print("Aer not available")

        or::

        try:
            from qiskit import IBMQ
        except ImportError:
            print("IBMQ not available")

    will no longer work. Instead to determine if those providers are present
    you can either explicitly use ``qiskit.providers.aer.Aer`` and
    ``qiskit.providers.ibmq.IBMQ``::

        try:
            from qiskit.providers.aer import Aer
        except ImportError:
            print("Aer not available")

        try:
            from qiskit.providers.ibmq import IBMQ
        except ImportError:
            print("IBMQ not available")

    or check ``bool(qiskit.Aer)`` and ``bool(qiskit.IBMQ)`` instead, for
    example::

        import qiskit

        if not qiskit.Aer:
            print("Aer not available")
        if not qiskit.IBMQ:
            print("IBMQ not available")

    This change was necessary to avoid potential import cycle issues between
    the qiskit packages and also to improve the import time when Aer or IBMQ
    are not being used.

    The user config file option ``suppress_packaging_warnings`` option in the
    user config file and the ``QISKIT_SUPPRESS_PACKAGING_WARNINGS`` environment
    variable no longer has any effect and will be silently ignored. The warnings
    this option controlled have been removed and will no longer be emitted at
    import time from the ``qiskit`` module.
