    Fixed an issue with :class:`~qiskit.circuit.Delay` objects in a
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit` where
    :func:`qiskit.compiler.transpile` would not be convert the units of
    the :class:`~qiskit.circuit.Delay` to the units of the
    :class:`~qiskit.providers.Backend`, if the ``backend`` kwarg is set on
    :func:`~qiskit.circuit.transpile`. This could result in the wrong behavior
    because of a unit mismatch, for example running::

      from qiskit import transpile, execute
      from qiskit.circuit import QuantumCircuit

      qc = QuantumCircuit(1)
      qc.delay(100, [0], unit='us')

      qc = transpile(qc, backend)
      job = execute(qc, backend)

    would previously have resulted in the backend delay for 100 timesteps (each
    of duration dt) rather than expected (100e-6 / dt) timesteps. This has been
    corrected so the :func:`qiskit.compiler.transpile` function properly
    converts the units.
