    `networkx <https://networkx.org/>`__ is no longer a requirement for
    qiskit-terra. All the networkx usage inside qiskit-terra has been removed
    with the exception of 3 methods:

    * :class:`qiskit.dagcircuit.DAGCircuit.to_networkx`
    * :class:`qiskit.dagcircuit.DAGCircuit.from_networkx`
    * :class:`qiskit.dagcircuit.DAGDependency.to_networkx`

    If you are using any of these methods you will need to manually install
    networkx in your environment to continue using them.
