    Support for passing :class:`~qiskit.circuit.Qubit` instances to the
    ``qubits`` kwarg of the :meth:`qiskit.transpiler.InstructionDurations.get`
    method has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
    Instead, you should call the
    :meth:`~qiskit.transpiler.InstructionDurations.get` method with the integer
    indices of the desired qubits.
