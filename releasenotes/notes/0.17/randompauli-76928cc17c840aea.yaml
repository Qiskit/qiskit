    A new class, :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.PauliTwoDesign`, was added
    to the :mod:`qiskit.circuit.library` which implements a particular form
    of a 2-design circuit from https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.11173.pdf
    For instance, this circuit can look like:
    
    .. jupyter-execute::

      from qiskit.circuit.library import PauliTwoDesign
      circuit = PauliTwoDesign(4, reps=2, seed=5, insert_barriers=True)
      circuit.decompose().draw(output='mpl')
