    In the transpiler pass :class:`qiskit.transpiler.passes.CSPLayout` a bias
    towards lower numbered qubits could be observed. This undesireable bias has
    been fixed by shuffling the candidates to randomize the results.
    Furthermore, the usage of the :class:`~qiskit.transpiler.passes.CSPLayout`
    pass in the :mod:`~qiskit.transpiler.preset_passmanagers` (for level 2 and
    3) has been adjusted to use a configured seed if the ``seed_transpiler``
    kwarg is set when :func:`~qiskit.compiler.transpile` is called.
    Fixed `#5990 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/5990>`__
