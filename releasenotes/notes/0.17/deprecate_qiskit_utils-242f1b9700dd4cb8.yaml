deprecations:

    The :mod:`qiskit.util` module has been deprecated and will be removed
    in a future release. It has been replaced by :mod:`qiskit.utils` which
    provides  the same functionality and will be expanded in the future. Note
    that no ``DeprecationWarning`` will be emitted regarding this deprecation
    since it was not feasible on Python 3.6.
