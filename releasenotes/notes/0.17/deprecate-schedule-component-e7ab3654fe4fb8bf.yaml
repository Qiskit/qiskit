deprecations:
  - |
    The :class:`qiskit.pulse.ScheduleComponent` class in the
    :mod:`qiskit.pulse` module has been deprecated and will be removed in a
    future release. Its usage should be replaced either using a
    :class:`qiskit.pulse.Schedule` or :class:`qiskit.pulse.Instruction`
    directly. Additionally, the primary purpose of the ``ScheduleComponent``
    class was as a common base class for both :class:`~qiskit.pulse.Schedule`
    and :class:`~qiskit.pulse.Instruction` for any place that was explicitly
    type checking or documenting accepting a ``ScheduleComponent`` input
    should be updated to accept :class:`~qiskit.pulse.Instruction` or
    :class:`~qiskit.pulse.Schedule`.
