    Fixed an issue with the labels of parametric pulses in the
    :class:`~qiskit.qobj.PulseQobjInstruction` class were not being properly
    set as they are with sampled pulses. This also means that pulse names
    that are imported from the :class:`~qiskit.providers.models.PulseDefaults`
    returned by a :class:`~qiskit.providers.Backend`, such as ``x90``, ``x90m``,
    etc, will properly be set.
    Fixed `#5363 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/5363>`__
