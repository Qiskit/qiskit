    The ``latex`` output method for the
    :func:`qiskit.visualization.circuit_drawer` function and the
    :meth:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.draw` method now will use a
    user defined label on gates in the output visualization. For example::

      import math

      from qiskit.circuit import QuantumCircuit

      qc = QuantumCircuit(2)
      qc.h(0)
      qc.rx(math.pi/2, 0, label='My Special Rotation')
    
      qc.draw(output='latex')
fixes:
  - |
    In a number of cases, the ``latex`` output method for the 
    :func:`qiskit.visualization.circuit_drawer` function and the
    :meth:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.draw` method did not display the
    gate name correctly, and in other cases, did not include gate parameters
    where they should be. Now the gate names will be displayed the same way
    as they are displayed with the ``mpl`` output method, and parameters will
    display for all the gates that have them. In addition, some of the gates
    did not display in the correct form, and these have been fixed. Fixes
