deprecations:

    Two new arguments have been added to
    :meth:`qiskit.dagcircuit.DAGNode.semantic_eq`, ``bit_indices1`` and
    ``bit_indices2``, which are expected to map the
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.Bit` instances in each
    :class:`~qiskit.dagcircuit.DAGNode` to their index in ``qubits`` or
    ``clbits`` list of their respective
    :class:`~qiskit.dagcircuit.DAGCircuit`. During the deprecation period,
    these arguments are optional and when **not** specified the mappings will
    be automatically constructed based on the ``register`` and ``index``
    properties of each :class:`~qiskit.circuit.Bit` instance. However, in a
    future release, they will be required arguments and the mapping will need
    to be supplied by the user.
