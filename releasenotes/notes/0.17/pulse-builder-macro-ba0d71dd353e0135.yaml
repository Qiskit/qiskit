    Added a new pulse builder function, :func:`qiskit.pulse.macro`.
    This enables normal Python functions to be decorated as macros.
    This enables pulse builder functions to be used within the decorated
    function. The builder macro can then be called from within a pulse
    building context, enabling code reuse.

    For Example:

    .. code-block:: python

        from qiskit import pulse

        @pulse.macro
        def measure(qubit: int):
            pulse.play(pulse.GaussianSquare(16384, 256, 15872),
                       pulse.MeasureChannel(qubit))
            mem_slot = pulse.MemorySlot(0)
            pulse.acquire(16384, pulse.AcquireChannel(0), mem_slot)
            return mem_slot

        with pulse.build(backend=backend) as sched:
            mem_slot = measure(0)
            print(f"Qubit measured into {mem_slot}")

        sched.draw()
