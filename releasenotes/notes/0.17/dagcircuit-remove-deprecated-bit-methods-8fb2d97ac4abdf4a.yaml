upgrade:
  - |
    The previously deprecated ``qubits()`` and ``clbits()`` methods on the
    :class:`~qiskit.dagcircuit.DAGCircuit` class, which were deprecated in the
    0.15.0 Terra release, have been removed. Instead you should use the 
    :attr:`~qiskit.dagcircuit.DAGCircuit.qubits` and
    :attr:`~qiskit.dagcircuit.DAGCircuit.clbits` attributes of the
    :class:`~qiskit.dagcircuit.DAGCircuit` class. For example, if you were
    running::

      from qiskit.dagcircuit import DAGCircuit

      dag = DAGCircuit()
      qubits = dag.qubits()

    That would be replaced by::

      from qiskit.dagcircuit import DAGCircuit

      dag = DAGCircuit()
      qubits = dag.qubits
