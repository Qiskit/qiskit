    Fixed the ``'circular'`` entanglement in the
    :class:`qiskit.circuit.library.NLocal` circuit class for the edge
    case where the circuit has the same size as the entanglement block (e.g. a two-qubit
    circuit and CZ entanglement gates). In this case there should only be one entanglement
    gate, but there was accidentally added a second one in the inverse direction as the 
    first.
    Fixed `Qiskit/qiskit-aqua#1452 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aqua/issues/1452>`__
