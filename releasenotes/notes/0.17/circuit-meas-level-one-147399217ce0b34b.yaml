    The :class:`~qiskit.qobj.QasmQobjConfig` class now has an optional
    kwarg for ``meas_level`` and ``meas_return``. These fields can be used
    to enable generating :class:`~qiskit.qobj.QasmQobj` job payloads that
    support ``meas_level=1`` (kerneled data) for circuit jobs (previously
    this was only exposed for :class:`~qiskit.qobj.PulseQobj` objects).
    The :func:`~qiskit.compiler.assemble` function has been updated
    to set this field for :class:`~qiskit.qobj.QasmQobj` objects it
    generates.
