upgrade:
  - |
    The previously deprecated ``mirror()`` method for
    :class:`qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit` has been removed. It was deprecated
    in the 0.15.0 release. The :meth:`qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.reverse_ops`
    method should be used instead since mirroring could be confused with
    swapping the output qubits of the circuit. The ``reverse_ops()`` method
    only reverses the order of gates that are applied instead of mirroring.
  - |
    The previously deprecated support passing a float (for the ``scale`` kwarg
    as the first positional argument to the
    :meth:`qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.draw` has been removed. It was
    deprecated in the 0.12.0 release. The first positional argument to the
    :meth:`qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.draw` method is now the ``output``
    kwarg which does not accept a float. Instead you should be using ``scale``
    as a named kwarg instead of using it positionally.

    For example, if you were previously calling ``draw`` with::

      from qiskit import QuantumCircuit

      qc = QuantumCircuit(2)
      qc.draw(0.75, output='mpl')

    this would now need to be::

      from qiskit import QuantumCircuit

      qc = QuantumCircuit(2)
      qc.draw(output='mpl', scale=0.75)

    or::

      qc.draw('mpl', scale=0.75)
