    The dictionary previously held on :class:`~qiskit.dagcircuit.DAGCircuit`
    edges has been removed. Instead, edges now hold the
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.Bit` instance which had previously been included in
    the dictionary as its ``'wire'`` field. Note that the NetworkX graph
    returned by :meth:`~qiskit.dagcircuit.DAGCircuit.to_networkx` will still
    have a dictionary for its edge attributes, but the ``'name'`` field will no
    longer be populated.
