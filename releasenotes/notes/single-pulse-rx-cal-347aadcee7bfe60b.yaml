    Two new transpiler passes are added to generate single-pulse RX gate calibrations on the fly.
    These single-pulse RX calibrations will reduce the gate time in half, as described in 
    P.Gokhale et al, Optimized Quantum Compilation for Near-Term Algorithms with OpenPulse 
    (2020), arXiv:2004.11205.

    To reduce the amount of RX calibration data that needs to be generated,
    :class:`qiskit.transpiler.passes.optimization.normalize_rx_angle.NormalizeRXAngle`
    performs three optimizations: wrapping RX gate rotation angles to [0, pi], 
    replacing RX(pi/2) and RX(pi) with SX and X gates, and quantizing the rotation angles.
    This pass is required to be run before 
    :class:`qiskit.transpiler.passes.calibration.rx_builder.RXCalibrationBuilder`,
    which generates RX calibrations on the fly.

    The details of the transpiler passes are as follows:
    :class:`qiskit.transpiler.passes.optimization.normalize_rx_angle.NormalizeRXAngle` wraps
    RX gate rotation angles to [0, pi] by replacing an RX gate with negative rotation angle, RX(-theta),
    with a sequence: RZ(pi)-RX(theta)-RZ(-pi). Moreover, the pass replaces RX(pi/2) with SX gate,
    and RX(pi) with X gate. This will enable us to exploit the more accurate, hardware-calibrated
    pulses. Lastly, the pass quantizes the rotation angles using a user-provided resolution.
    If the resolution is set to 0, this pass will not perform any quantization.
    :class:`qiskit.transpiler.passes.calibration.rx_builder.RXCalibrationBuilder`
    generates RX calibrations on the fly. The pulse calibrations are bootstrapped from 
    the SX gate calibration in the target.
    The amplitude is linearly scaled to achieve the desired arbitrary rotation angle.
    Such single-pulse calibrations reduces the gate time in half, compared to the 
    conventional sequence that consists of two SX pulses.
    There could be an improvement in fidelity due to this reduction in gate time.
