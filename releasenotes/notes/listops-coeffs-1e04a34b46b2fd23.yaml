    opflow.ListOp class now supports a property method `coeffs` which returns
    a list of the coefficients of the operator list, with the overall
    coefficient (`ListOp.coeff`) distributed multiplicatively into the list. 
    Note that `ListOp` objects may be nested (contained in `oplist` of a  
    `ListOp` object), and in these cases an exception is raised if the 
    `coeffs` method is called.
    The `ListOp.coeffs` method conveniently duck-types against the
    `coeffs` property method of the non-nesting `PauliSumOp` class.
