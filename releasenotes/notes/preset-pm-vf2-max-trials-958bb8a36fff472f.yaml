    The maximum number of trials evaluated when searching for the best
    layout using :class:`.VF2Layout` is now limited in
    :func:`qiskit.transpiler.preset_passmanagers.level_1_pass_manager`,
    :func:`qiskit.transpiler.preset_passmanagers.level_2_pass_manager`,
    and
    :func:`qiskit.transpiler.preset_passmanagers.level_3_pass_manager`
    to ``2,500``, ``25,000``, and ``250,000``, respectively. Previously,
    all possible layouts were evaluated. To perform a full search as
    before, manually run :class:`.VF2PostLayout` over the transpiled circuit,
    in strict mode, specifying ``0`` for ``max_trials``.
fixes:

    Fixed a potential performance scaling issue with layout scoring in preset
    pass managers, which could occur when transpiling circuits with many
    connected components on large devices.
