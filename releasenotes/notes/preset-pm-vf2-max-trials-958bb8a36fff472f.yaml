    The maximum number of trials evaluated when searching for the best
    layout using :class:`.VF2Layout` and :class:`.VF2PostLayout` is now
    limited in
    :func:`qiskit.transpiler.preset_passmanagers.level_1_pass_manager`,
    :func:`qiskit.transpiler.preset_passmanagers.level_2_pass_manager`,
    and
    :func:`qiskit.transpiler.preset_passmanagers.level_3_pass_manager`
    to ``2,500``, ``25,000``, and ``250,000``, respectively. Previously,
    all possible layouts were evaluated. This change was made to prevent
    transpilation from hanging during layout scoring for circuits with many
    connected components on larger devices, which scales combinatorially
    since each connected component must be evaluated in all possible
    positions on the device. To perform a full search as
    before, manually run :class:`.VF2PostLayout` over the transpiled circuit
    in strict mode, specifying ``0`` for ``max_trials``.

    Fixed a potential performance scaling issue with layout scoring in preset
    pass managers, which could occur when transpiling circuits with many
    connected components on large devices.
