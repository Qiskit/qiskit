    :class:`.SabreSwap` and :class:`.SabreLayout` will now raise a :exc:`.TranspilerError` if they
    encounter a multi-qubit gate.  The algorithms previously silently treated these as if they were
    "directives" with no routing considerations (with documentation implying that the circuit
    should have been decomposed into single- and two-qubit gates).
