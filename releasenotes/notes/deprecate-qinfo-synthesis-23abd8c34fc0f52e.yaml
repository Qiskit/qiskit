deprecations:
  - |
    The :mod:`qiskit.quantum_info.synthesis` module is pending deprecation and
    will be deprecated in a future release. The following objects have been moved to
    :mod:`qiskit.synthesis`:

    * :class:`~.OneQubitEulerDecomposer` has been moved to :mod:`qiskit.synthesis.one_qubit`
    * :class:`~.TwoQubitBasisDecomposer` has been moved to :mod:`qiskit.synthesis.two_qubits`
    * :class:`~.XXDecomposer` has been moved to :mod:`qiskit.synthesis.two_qubits`
    * :func:`~.two_qubit_cnot_decompose` has been moved to :mod:`qiskit.synthesis.two_qubits`
    * :func:`~.qs_decomposition` has been moved to :mod:`qiskit.synthesis.unitary`

    The class :class:`.Quaternion` has been migrated from :mod:`qiskit.quantum_info.synthesis` to
    :mod:`qiskit.quantum_info`. This move has not affected the usual import path of the class.

    This function has already been deprecated in this release:

    * :func:`~.cnot_rxx_decompose`

    These functions were removed, since they have already been deprecated in a previous release:

    * :func:`~.decompose_clifford` (use :func:`.qiskit.synthesis.synth_clifford_full` instead)
    * :func:`~.decompose_cnotdihedral` (use :func:`.qiskit.synthesis.synth_cnotdihedral_full` instead)
