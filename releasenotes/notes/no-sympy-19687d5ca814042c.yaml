    ``sympy`` is no longer a requirement for installing Qiskit. After the migration to
    a Rust based symbolic engine for the :class:`.ParameterExpression` class the uses
    of Sympy are isolated to some visualization utilities and the
    :class:`.TemplateOptimization` transpiler pass. This functionality is not the most
    commonly used so sympy is now treated as an optional dependency and those functions
    will raising a :class:`.MissingOptionalLibrary` exception if they're used and
    sympy has not been manually installed.
