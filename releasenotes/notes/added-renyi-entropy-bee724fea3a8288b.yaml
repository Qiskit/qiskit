    Added the function :func:`~qiskit.quantum_info.states.measures.renyi_entropy` which 
    computes the Renyi entropy with arbitrary index :math:`\alpha` of an optionally specified 
    subsystem. By default, the subsystem is taken to be the entire system. For inputs of 
    :class:`~.quantum_info.StabilizerState`, the entropy is computed efficiently in terms of 
    the binary rank of the reduced stabilizer tableau.
