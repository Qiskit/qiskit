    The documentation for the :class:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit` method
    :meth:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.draw` and the
    :func:`~qiskit.visualization.circuit_drawer` function were out-of-sync with
    the state of the code. The documentation has been brought up-to-date. As
    part of this update, 3 elements of the `mpl` drawer `style` parameter dictionary
    have been removed since they were not implemented in the code and not needed.
    These are `latexdrawerstyle`, `usepiformat`, and `compress`.

    In previous versions of qiskit, there was a rudimentary functionality that
    allowed users to load an `mpl` drawer `style` dictionary from a JSON file in
    order to customize the colors and other display features of the `mpl` drawer.
    This capability has now been expanded so that all `style` dictionaries are
    loaded from JSON files, and users can copy and customize the standard style
    JSON files included with qiskit - `default.json`, `iqx.json`, and `bw.json`.
    Users can indicate the path to be searched for any user style JSON files by
    setting ``circuit_mpl_style_path`` under the [Default] heading in the file
    ``settings.conf`` in the ``~/.qiskit`` directory. Path entries should be
    separated by `:`. For example,
    ``circuit_mpl_style_path = ~/.qiskit:~/user_styles``
