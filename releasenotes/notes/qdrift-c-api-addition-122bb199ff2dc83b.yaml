prelude: >
    Replace this text with content to appear at the top of the section for this
    release. All of the prelude content is merged together and then rendered
    separately from the items listed in other parts of the file, so the text
    needs to be worded so that both the prelude and the other items make sense
    when read independently. This may mean repeating some details. Not every
    release note requires a prelude. Usually only notes describing major
    features or adding release theme details should have a prelude.
features:
  - |
    List new features here, or remove this section.  All of the list items in
    this section are combined when the release notes are rendered, so the text
    needs to be worded so that it does not depend on any information only
    available in another section, such as the prelude. This may mean repeating
    some details. If the feature note is contained within one of the modules
    listed below you should use the appropriate subsection instead.
features_c:

    Introduced a new feature in the C API circuit library to synthesize QDRIFT
    circuits. The function `qk_circuit_library_qdrift` allows users to create
    quantum circuits that approximate the time evolution under a given sparse
    observable using the QDRIFT algorithm. For example::

        #include <qiskit.h>
        // Create a sparse observable representing the Hamiltonian
        QkObs *obs = qk_obs_zero(2); // 2-qubit observable
        // Add terms to the observable (e.g., Pauli strings with coefficients)
        QkBitTerm bit_term[2] = {QkBitTerm_Z, QkBitTerm_Z};
        QkComplex64 coeff = {1, 0};
        uint32_t indices[2] = {0, 1};
        QkObsTerm term_2 = {coeff, 2, bit_term, indices, 2};
        code = qk_obs_add_term(obs, &term_2);
