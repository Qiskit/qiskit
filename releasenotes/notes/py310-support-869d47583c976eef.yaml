    Added support for running with Python 3.10. This includes publishing
    precompiled binaries to PyPI for Python 3.10 on supported platforms.
upgrade:
  - |
    Qiskit no longer fully supports 32 bit platforms, Linux i686 and Windows
    32bit, on Python >= 3.10. This is because the upstream dependencies Numpy
    and Scipy do not support these platforms on Python 3.10 and we're unable to
    reliably test on these platforms anymore. Qiskit will still publish
    precompiled binaries for these platforms but we're unable to test them
    prior to publishing and you will need a C/C++ compiler to install them
    as numpy, scipy, and potentially other dependencies will need to be built
    from source when installing qiskit-terra on Python 3.10 on linux i686 or
    win32. If you're running on i686 or win32 platforms it is recommended that
    you use Python 3.7, 3.8, or 3.9.
