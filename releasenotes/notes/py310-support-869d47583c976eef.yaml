    Added support for running with Python 3.10. This includes publishing
    precompiled binaries to PyPI for Python 3.10 on supported platforms.
upgrade:
  - |
    Qiskit Terra no longer fully supports 32 bit platforms on Python >= 3.10.
    These are Linux i686 and 32-bit Windows. These platforms with Python 3.10
    are now at Tier 3 instead of Tier 2 support (per the tiers defined in:
    https://qiskit.org/documentation/getting_started.html#platform-support)
    This is because the upstream dependencies Numpy and Scipy have dropped
    support for them. Qiskit will still publish precompiled binaries for these
    platforms, but we're unable to test the packages prior to publishing, and
    you will need a C/C++ compiler so that ``pip`` can build their dependencies
    from source. If you're using one of these platforms, we recommended that
    you use Python 3.7, 3.8, or 3.9.
