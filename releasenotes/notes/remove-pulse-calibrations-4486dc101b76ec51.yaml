    As part of Pulse removal in Qiskit 2.0, the ``calibrations`` property has been removed
    from the :class:`.QuantumCircuit`, :class:`.DAGCircuit` and :class:`.DAGDependency` classes.
    In addition, the method ``has_calibration_for`` has been removed from the :class:`.QuantumCircuit` and
    :class:`.DAGCircuit` classes and ``add_calibration`` has been removed from :class:`.QuantumCircuit`.
upgrade_transpiler:

    As part of Pulse removal in Qiskit 2.0, all pulse and calibration related functionality
    in the transpiler has been removed. This includes the following:

    Passes that have been removed:

      * ``qiskit.transpiler.passes.PulseGates``
      * ``qiskit.transpiler.passes.ValidatePulseGates``
      * ``qiskit.transpiler.passes.RXCalibrationBuilder``
      * ``qiskit.transpiler.passes.RZXCalibrationBuilder``
      * ``qiskit.transpiler.passes.RZXCalibrationBuilderNoEcho``
      * ``qiskit.transpiler.passes.EchoRZXWeylDecomposition``

    The ``inst_map`` argument has been removed from the following elements:

      * The :func:`.generate_preset_pass_manager` and :func:`.transpile` functions
      * The :meth:`.Target.from_configuration` method
      * The constructor of the :class:`.PassManagerConfig` class

    Calibration support has been removed:

      * ``calibration`` has been removed from the :class:`.InstructionProperties` 's constructor and is no longer a property of that class.
      * The ``has_calibration``, ``get_calibration``, ``instruction_schedule_map`` and ``update_from_instruction_schedule_map`` methods have been removed from the :class:`.Target` class.
