    Add new utility functions to handle linear functions and circuits:
    * A utility function that checks whether a NxN binary matrix is invertible.
    * A utility function that computes an inverse of a NxN invertible binary matrix.
    * A utility function that calculates the transpose of a linear reversible circuit.
    * Implement the following "meta" idea for synthesizing linear functions:
    given an invertible binary matrix A and a synthesis algorithm f: A -> QuantumCircuit,
    in addition to applying f to A, we can also apply f to A^{-1} and invert the computed circuit,
    apply f to A^{T} and transpose the computed circuit, and to apply f to A^{T}^{-1} and to invert
    and transpose the computed circuit, thus leading to 4 generally different synthesized circuits for A,
    allowing to pick the best one in terms of depth or the number of gates.
upgrade:

    Improve code structure by moving the internal code graysynth.py from qiskit/transpiler/synthesis
    to qiskit/synthesis/linear, and renaming cnot_synth to synth_cnot_count_full_pmh.
fixes:
  - |
    Provide an internal utility function to generate a random NxN invertible binary matrix.
    This function is completely robust, as opposed to the previously implemented method based on
    computing determinant (via np.linalg.det) and checking that it's close to 1,
    where we already saw cases of floating point errors leading to an incorrect result (for N>100).
