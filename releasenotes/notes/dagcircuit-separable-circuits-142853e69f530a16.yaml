features:
  - |
    This feature introduces a new `DAGCircuit` class method,
    `separable_circuits`, which returns a list of `DAGCircuit` objects,
    one for each mutually disconnected set of qubits in the `DAGCircuit` object.

    This method  will not return a DAG for idle wires.

issues:
  - |
    The subgraphs returned from `DAGCircuit.separable_circuits` will not
    contain the global phase information of the parent `DAGCircuit`.
