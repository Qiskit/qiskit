    Introduced a new :class:`.DAGCircuit` method,
    :meth:`~.DAGCircuit.separable_circuits`, which returns a list of :class:`.DAGCircuit` objects,
    one for each set of connected qubits which have no gates connecting them to another
    set.

    This method  will not return a DAG solely of classical bits.
