    There is currently no easy way to retrieve all of the disconnected subsets
    of qubits in a quantum circuit with Qiskit. This feature introduces a new
    `DAGCircuit` class method, `separable_circuits`, which returns a list of
    `DAGCircuit` objects -- one for each mutually disconnected set of qubits
    in the `DAGCircuit` object.

    This method  will not return a DAG for idle wires.

issues:
  - |
    The subgraphs returned from `DAGCircuit.separable_circuits` will not
    contain the global phase information of the parent `DAGCircuit`.
