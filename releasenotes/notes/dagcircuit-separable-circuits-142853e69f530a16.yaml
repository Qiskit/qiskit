features:
  - |
    Introduced a new :class:`.DAGCircuit` class method,
    :meth:`~.separable_circuits`, which returns a list of :class:`.DAGCircuit` objects,
    one for each set of connected qubits which have no gates connecting them to another
    set.

    This method  will not return a DAG solely of classical bits.

issues:
  - |
    The subcircuits returned from `DAGCircuit.separable_circuits` will not
    retain the global phase information of the parent :class:`.DAGCircuit`.
    All subcircuit global phases will be zero.
