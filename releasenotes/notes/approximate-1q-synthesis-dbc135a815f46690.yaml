features:
  - |
    "PSX"-style circuit synthesis for single-qubit operators now supports
    options for approximate and fidelity-aware decompositions.
fixes:
  - |
    Certain cases of numerical instability could previously erroneously trigger
    a warning that Qiskit was emitting inefficient synthesized circuits.  This
    is now triggered only by an unanticipated drop in expected operational
    fidelity, which should eliminate these unnecessary warnings.
