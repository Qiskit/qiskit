    The :attr:`.QuantumCircuit.unit` and :attr:`.QuantumCircuit.duration`
    attributes have been deprecated and will be removed in Qiskit 2.0.0. These
    attributes were used to track the estimated duration and unit of that
    duration to execute on the circuit. However, the values of these attributes
    were always limited, as they would only be properly populated if the
    transpiler were run with the correct settings. The duration was also only a
    guess based on the longest path on the sum of the duration of
    :class:`.DAGCircuit` and wouldn't ever correctly account for control flow
    or conditionals in the circuit.

    The :attr:`.Instruction.duration` and :attr:`.Instruction.unit` attributes
    have been deprecated and will be removed in Qiskit 2.0.0. These attributes
    were used to attach a custom execution duration and unit for that duration
    to an individual instruction. However, the source of truth of the duration
    of a gate is the :class:`.BackendV2` :class:`.Target` which contains
    the duration for each instruction supported on the backend. The duration of
    an instruction is not something that's typically user adjustable and is
    an immutable property of the backend. If you were previously using this
    capability to experiment with different durations for gates you can
    mutate the :attr:`.InstructionProperties.duration` field in a given
    :class:`.Target` to set a custom duration for an instruction on a backend
    (the unit is always in seconds in the :class:`.Target`).
