    Some heuristic for value calculations in SymbolExpr.
    `(a + 1.5) + 0.2` was not calculated on the fly previously, this caused
    performance degradation shown in #14653, now the equation is calculated
    as `a + 1.7` that saves memory usages and improves the performance.

    Also integer fractional is supported to calculate exactly.
    `a/3 + 2*a/3` was not calculated as `a` previously, now SymbolExpr can
    calculate as `a` exactly.
