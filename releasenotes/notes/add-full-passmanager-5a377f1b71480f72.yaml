    Added a new class, :class:`qiskit.transpiler.FullPassManager`, which is
    a :class:`~qiskit.transpiler.PassManager` subclass that has a pipeline
    with defined phases to the circuit compilation. Each phase is a
    :class:`~qiskit.transpiler.PassManager` object that will get executed
    in a fixed order. For example::

      from qiskit.transpiler.passes import *
      from qiskit.transpiler import PassManager, FullPassManager

      basis_gates = ['rx', 'ry', 'rxx']
      init = PassManager([UnitarySynthesis(basis_gates), Unroll3qOrMore()])
      translate = PassManager([Collect2qBlocks(),
                               ConsolidateBlocks(basis_gates=basis_gates),
                               UnitarySynthesis(basis_gates)])

      full_pass_manager = FullPassManager(init=init, translation=translate)
