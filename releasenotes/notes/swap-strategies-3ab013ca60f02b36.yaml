    New transpiler passes have been added. The transpiler passes
    ``SwapStrategyRouter`` is a base class for transpiler passes that use swap
    strategies to route a block of commuting gates to the coupling map. Indeed,
    routing is a hard problem but is significantly easier when the gates
    commute. This is often found in variational algorithms such as QAOA. Such
    cases can be dealt with using swap strategies that apply a predefined set
    of layers of SWAP gates. The child class :class:`qiskit.transpiler.passes.routing.swap_strategies.swap_strategy_router.PauliEvolutionGateRouter` is
    used to route ``PauliEvolutionGate`` instructions in which all the Pauli
    terms commute. Such evolution gates are identified in the dag using the
    ``CheckCommutingEvolutions`` analysis pass. Finally, a swap strategy is
    specified by the class ``SwapStrategy``. Swap strategies need to be tailored
    to the coupling map and, ideally, the circuit for the best results.
