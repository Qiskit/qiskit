   New transpiler passes for routing communiting gates have been added.
   Routing is a hard problem but is significantly easier when the gates commute as in CZ networks.
   Blocks of commuting gates are also typically found in QAOA. Such cases can be dealt with
   using swap strategies that apply a predefined set of layers of SWAP gates.
   There are two new passes that find commuting blocks of 2-qubit gates:

   * :class:`.FindCommutingPauliEvolutions` identifies blocks of Pauli evolutions
     made of commuting two-qubit terms and replace them by :class:`.Commuting2qBlock`.
   * :class:`.Commuting2qGateGrouper` its a generalization in which all the community 2-qubits
     gates are replaced by :class:`.Commuting2qBlock`.

   The transpiler pass :class:`.Commuting2qGateRouter` takes :class:`.Commuting2qBlock`s and
   uses swap strategies to route a block of commuting gates to the coupling map.
   Here, a swap strategy is specified by the class
   :class:`.SwapStrategy`. Swap strategies need to be tailored to the coupling map and, ideally,
   the circuit for the best results.
