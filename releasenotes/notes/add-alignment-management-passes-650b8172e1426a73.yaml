    Added new passes `AlignMeasures` and `ValidatePulseGates` that manage the hardware
    waveform memory constraints on time allocation of instructions. These passes are triggered
    when pulse constraints with finite alignment factor > 1 is specified to the transpiler argument.
    The alignment may indicate the chunk size of the hardware waveform memory,
    and all instruction should have data point length of multiple of it.
    Thus these passes are hardware (pulse controller) aware optimization and validation routine.
    This value may be provided by the backend configuration field, or you can
    set arbitrary pulse constraints dictionary directly to the transpiler.
    If backend doesn't provide the pulse constraints information, then constraints with
    all alignment factors of 1 is set by default. In this case, execution of these passes
    are just skipped. Backends assigned to IBM Quantum Services will shortly provide this
    new information to provide better optimization of circuits before execution.
