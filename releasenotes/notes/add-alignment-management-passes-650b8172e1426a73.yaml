    Added new passes `AlignMeasures` and `ValidatePulseGates` that manage the hardware
    instruction scheduling constraints. These passes are triggered when timing constraints
    with finite alignment factor > 1 is specified to the transpiler argument,
    or such constraints are reported by the backend configuration.
    These passes are hardware (pulse controller) aware optimization and validation routine.
    See :class:`~qiskit.transpiler.timing_constraints.TimingConstraints` for details.

    If backend doesn't provide the timing constraints information, then a constraint object with
    all alignment factors of 1 is set by default. In this case, execution of these passes
    are just skipped. Backends assigned to IBM Quantum Services will shortly provide this
    new information to offer better optimization of circuits before execution.
