    Added new passes `AlignMeasures` and `ValidatePulseGates` that manage the alignment
    restriction on time allocation of instructions. These passes are triggered when
    finite alignment factor > 1 is specified to the transpiler argument.
    The alignment may indicate the chunk size of the hardware waveform memory,
    and all instruction should have data point length of multiple of it.
    Thus these passes are hardware (pulse controller) aware optimization and validation routine.
    This value may be provided by the backend configuration field, or you can
    set arbitrary alignment value directly to the transpiler.
    If backend doesn't provide alignment information, then this value defaults to 1 and
    execution of these passes are just skipped.
    Backends assigned to IBM Quantum Services will shortly provide this new information to
    provide better optimization of circuits before execution.
