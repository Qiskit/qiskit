    The algorithm iteratively computes each eigenstate by starting from the ground 
    state (which is computed as in VQE) and then optimising a modified cost function 
    that tries to compute eigen states that are orthogonal to the states computed in 
    the previous iterations and have the lowest energy when computed over the ansatz.
    The interface implemented is very similar to that of VQE and is of the form:
    
      from qiskit.algorithms import VQD

      vqd = VQD(ansatz = ansatz, k = 2, optimizer = opt, quantum_instance = qi)
      vqd_res = vqd.compute_eigenvalues(op)
    
    This particular code snippet generates 2 eigenvalues (ground and 1st excited state)
    Tests have also been implemented.
