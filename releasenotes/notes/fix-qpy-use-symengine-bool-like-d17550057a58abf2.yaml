    Fixed an issue with the :func:`.qpy.dump` function, when the
    ``use_symengine`` flag was set to a truthy object that evaluated to
    ``True`` but was not actually the boolean ``True`` the generated QPY
    payload would be corrupt. For example, if you set ``use_symengine`` to
    :obj:`.HAS_SYMENGINE` which evaluates to ``True`` when cast as a bool,
    but isn't actually ``True``.
