    By default Qiskit builds its compiled extensions using the
    `Python Stable ABI <https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/stable.html>`__
    with support back to the oldest version of Python supported by Qiskit
    (currently 3.8). This means that moving forward there
    will be a single precompiled wheels that are shipped on release that
    works with all of Qiskit's supported Python versions. There isn't any
    expected runtime performance difference using the limited API so it is
    enabled by default for all builds now.
    Previously, the compiled extensions were built using the version specific API and
    would only work with a single Python version. This change was made
    to reduce the number of package files we need to build and publish in each
    release. When building Qiskit from source there should be no changes
    necessary to the build process except that the default tags in the output
    filenames will be different to reflect the use of the limited API.
