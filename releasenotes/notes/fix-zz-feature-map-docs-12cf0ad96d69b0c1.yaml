    Fixed an incomplete sentence in the docstrings for :func:`.zz_feature_map` and
    :class:`.ZZFeatureMap` where the data-mapping function conditions were cut off.
    The documentation now correctly states that :math:`\varphi(x) = x` if :math:`|S| = 1`
    and :math:`\varphi(x,y) = (\pi - x)(\pi - y)` if :math:`|S| > 1`.
    Also added missing parameter documentation to :func:`.pauli_feature_map`,
    :func:`.z_feature_map`, and :func:`.zz_feature_map`.
    See `#15676 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/15676>`__.
