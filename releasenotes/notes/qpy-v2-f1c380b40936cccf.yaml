    QPY serialization is now capable of representing
    :attr:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.global_phase` attributes of a
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit` object that are a ``int``,
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.Parameter` object, or
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.ParameterExpression` object. Previous versions of
    QPY would only accept a :attr:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.global_phase`
    that was a ``float``.

    This requires the QPY format :ref:`version_2` which was introduced in
    this release to represent the additional types.
