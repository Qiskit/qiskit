    Added a new transpiler pass, :class:`~ResetAfterMeasureSimplification`,
    which is used to replace a :class:`~.Reset` operation after a
    :class:`~.Measure` with a conditional :class:`~.XGate`. This pass can
    be used on backends where a :class:`~.Reset` operation is performed by
    doing a measurement and then a conditional X gate so that this will
    remove the duplicate implicit :class:`~.Measure` from the :class:`~.Reset`
    operation.
