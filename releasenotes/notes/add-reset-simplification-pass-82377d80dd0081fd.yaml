    Added a new transpiler pass, :class:`~ResetAfterMeasureSimplification`,
    which is used to replace a :class:`~.Reset` operation after a
    :class:`~.Measure` with a conditional :class:`~.XGate`. For IBM backends
    this :class:`~.Reset` operation is performed by doing a measurement and
    then a conditional X gate. So if used with an IBM backend this pass will
    remove a duplicate implicit :class:`~.Measure` from the :class:`~.Reset`
    operation.
