features:
  - |
    Adds ``plot_distribution``for plotting distributions over quasi-probabilities.
    This is suitable for ``Counts``, ``QuasiDistribution`` and ``ProbDistribution``.
    Raw `dict` can be passed as well.
upgrade:
  - |
    Modifies ``plot_histogram`` to return an actual histogram of discrete binned values.
    As the values are discrete, only ``Counts`` and ``dict`` objects are allowed.
    ``dict`` objects are not validated for correctness, e.g. discrete values.
