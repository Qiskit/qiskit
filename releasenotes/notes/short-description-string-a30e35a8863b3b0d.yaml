    This PR adds a new feature - "Entangling capacity" a metric to measure quality of ansatz for variational algorithms. there is a python file added called "test_entanglement" which shows how to call the function entanglement to measure the entangling capacity of any ansatz in a variational algorithm. Issue in Qiskit-terra - https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/8176
features:

    We have implemented Entangling capacity using two different measures - Meyer Wallach measure (proposed in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10876.pdf ) as well as using Von Neumann measure. Users can choose between the two measures and if not mentioned Meyer Wallach will run by default.

    Changes required in the qiskit.utils library:
    Introduced a new folder Entanglement with 3 python scripts with function as follows: (i) circuit.py - has the circuits comprising of 19 parametric circuits in the https://doi.org/10.1007/s42484-021-00038-w
    (ii) meyer_wallach_measure.py - computes the meyer wallach entanglement measure.
    (iii) von_neumann_entropy.py - computes the von neumann entanglement measure.
    We have introduced changes in the python script of /qiskit/utils/circuit_util.py and added a class entanglement which is utility class to calculate the entanglement capability of a particular parametric circuit with initialized parameters using the function present in the /qiskit/utils/entaglement/
