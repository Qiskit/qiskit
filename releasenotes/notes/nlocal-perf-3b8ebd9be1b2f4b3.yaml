    The construction performance of :class:`.NLocal` and its derived circuit-library subclasses
    (e.g. :class:`.EfficientSU2` and :class:`.RealAmplitudes`) has significantly improved, when the
    rotation and/or entanglement subblocks are simple applications of a single Qiskit
    standard-library gate.  Since these circuits are constructed lazily, you might not see the
    improvement immediately on instantiation of the class, but instead on first access to its
    internal structure.  Performance improvements are on the order of ten times faster.
