    Fixed a bug in the circuit functions :func:`.evolved_operator_ansatz`,
    :func:`.qaoa_ansatz` and :func:`.hamiltonian_variational_ansatz`, where the
    parameters had a zero complex component. This was normally not an issue unless
    the parameter was translated to SymPy using the
    :meth:`.ParameterExpression.sympify` method, which would then raise an
    error.
