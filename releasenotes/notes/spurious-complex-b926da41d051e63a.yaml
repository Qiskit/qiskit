    Fixed a bug in the circuit functions :func:`.evolved_operator_ansatz`,
    :func:`.qaoa_ansatz` and :func:`.hamiltonian_variational_ansatz`, where the
    parameters had a zero complex component.  This mostly was no issue, unless
    translated to SymPy using the :meth:`.ParameterExpression.sympify` method,
    which would then raise an error.
