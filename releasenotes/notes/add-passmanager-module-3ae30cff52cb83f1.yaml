    A new module :mod:`qiskit.passmanager` is added.
    This module implements a generic pass manager and flow controllers,
    and provides an infrastructure to manage execution of transform passes.
    The pass manager is a baseclass and not aware of the input and output object types,
    and you need to create a subclass of the pass manager
    for a particular program data to optimize.
    The :mod:`qiskit.transpiler` module is also reorganized to rebuild the existing
    quantum circuit pass manager based off of new generic pass manager.
    See upgrade notes for more details.
upgrade:
  - |
    :class:`qiskit.transpiler.PassManager` is now a subclass of
    :class:`qiskit.passmanager.BasePassManager`. There is no functional modification
    due to this class hierarchy change.
  - |
    New error baseclass :class:`~qiskit.passmanager.PassManagerError` is introduced.
    This will replace :class:`~qiskit.transpiler.TranspilerError` raised in the
    pass handling machinery. The TranspilerError is now only used for the errors
    related to the failure in handling the quantum circuit or DAG circuit object.
    Note that the TranspilerError can be caught by the PassManagerError
    because of their class hierarchy. For backward compatibility,
    :class:`qiskit.transpiler.PassManager` catches PassManagerError and
    re-raises the TranspilerError. This error replacement will be dropped in future.
