features:
  - |
    Added :meth:`.LinearFunction.__eq__` method. Two objects of type :class:`.LinearFunction`
    are considered equal when their representations as binary invertible matrices are equal.
  - |
    Added :meth:`.LinearFunction.extend_with_identity` method, which allows to extend
    a linear function over ``k`` qubits to a linear function over ``n >= k`` qubits,
    with identities on other subsystems.
  - |
    Allowing to construct a :class:`.LinearFunction` from a quantum circuit with
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.Barrier` and :class:`~qiskit.circuit.Delay` instructions.
