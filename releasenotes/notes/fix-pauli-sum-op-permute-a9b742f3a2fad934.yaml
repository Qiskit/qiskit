    Fix a bug in the :class:`~qiskit.opflow.PauliSumOp` which previously stored the
    :class:`~qiskit.quantum_info.SparsePauliOp` it was instantiated with by reference and not
    by value. This led to several bugs, where e.g. the ``PauliSumOp`` was affected by changes in the
    original ``SparsePauliOp`` or methods such as :meth:`~qiskit.opflow.PauliSumOp.permute` modified
    the object they are called on instead of leaving them unchanged.
