    It is no longer allowed to pass a :class:`~qiskit.qobj.QasmQobj` as the first input to
    The :meth:`~qiskit.providers.basicaer.UnitarySimulatorPy.run`. This functionality was 
    deprecated in Qiskit 0.46 and has now been removed.

    Example usage:

      from qiskit import transpile, QuantumCircuit
      from qiskit.providers.basicaer import BasicAer

      backend = BasicAer.get_backend('unitary_simulator')
      circuit = QuantumCircuit(2)
      qc.h(0)
      qc.cx(0, 1)
      qc.measure_all()
      tqc = transpile(circuit, backend)
      result = backend.run(tqc).result()
