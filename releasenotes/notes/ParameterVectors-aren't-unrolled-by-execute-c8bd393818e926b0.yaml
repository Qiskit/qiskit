    Fixed issue where circuit.execute would raise exception when 
    ParameterVectors were passed in the parameter_bind parameter.
    Refer to `#5467 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/5467>` for more
    details. 
    It is now possible to call:
    execute(circuit, backend, parameter_binds=[{pv1: [...], pv2: [...]}])
