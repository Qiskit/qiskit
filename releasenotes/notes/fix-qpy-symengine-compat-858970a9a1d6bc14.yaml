    Fixed an issue with :func:`.qpy.load` when loading a QPY payload that
    contains a :class:`.ParameterExpression` that was generated when symengine
    0.11 was installed and trying to load it in an environment where symengine
    0.13 (the latest symengine release as of this qiskit release) or vice versa.
    Previously, an error would have been raised by symengine around this version
    mismatch. This has been worked around for these two specific symengine versions
    but if you're trying to use different versions of symengine and there is a
    mismatch with this version of Qiskit this might not work. You will need to
    install Qiskit >1.3.0 to fix this mismatch issue more broadly for any potential
    future version of symengine.
