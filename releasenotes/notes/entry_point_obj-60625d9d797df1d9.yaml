    The function ``passmanager_stage_plugins`` in the module
    ``qiskit.transpiler.preset_passmanagers.plugin`` was added to obtain a map between
    plugin names and their  class type.
    This allows to identify and query passmanager plugin documentation. For example::

        >>> from qiskit.transpiler.preset_passmanagers.plugin import passmanager_stage_plugins
        >>> passmanager_stage_plugins('routing')['lookahead'].__class__
        qiskit.transpiler.preset_passmanagers.builtin_plugins.LookaheadSwapPassManager

        >>> help(passmanager_stage_plugins('routing')['lookahead'])
        Help on BasicSwapPassManager in module qiskit.transpiler.preset_passmanagers.builtin_plugins object:

        class BasicSwapPassManager(qiskit.transpiler.preset_passmanagers.plugin.PassManagerStagePlugin)
        |  Plugin class for routing stage with :class:`~.BasicSwap`
        ...
