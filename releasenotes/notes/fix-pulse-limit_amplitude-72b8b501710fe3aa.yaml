    Fixed an issue where the ``limit_amplitude`` argument on an individual
    :class:`~.SymbolicPulse` or :class:`~.Waveform` instance
    was not properly reflected by parameter validation. In addition, QPY
    schedule :func:`~qiskit.qpy.dump` has been fixed to correctly
    store the ``limit_amplitude`` value tied to the instance, rather than
    saving the global class variable.
