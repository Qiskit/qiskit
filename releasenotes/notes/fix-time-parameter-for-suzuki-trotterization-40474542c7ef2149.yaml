    Fix wrong time value in Trotterized unitary #8126.
    When Computing a suzuki decomposition of a Hamiltonian for a given time t, if t is a float, everything works fine. 
    If t is a Parameter object the value gets squared when it is bound.
    This is tested with function test_suzuki_trotterization_time_parameter(self).
