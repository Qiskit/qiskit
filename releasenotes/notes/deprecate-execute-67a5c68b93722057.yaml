deprecations:
  - |
    Qiskit's :func:`~.execute_function.execute` function is deprecated.
    This function served as a high-level wrapper around transpiling
    a circuit with some transpile options and running it on a backend
    with some run options. To do the same thing, you can explicitly
    use the :func:`~.transpile` function (with appropriate transpile
    options) followed by `backend.run()` (with appropriate run options).

   For example, instead of running::

      from qiskit import execute
      job = execute(circuit, backend)

   you can run::

      from qiskit import transpile
      new_circuit = transpile(circuit)
      job = backend.run(new_circuit)
