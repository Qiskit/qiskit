    Previously, the :class:`.CommutationChecker` eagerly cached the commutation relations of
    :class:`~.circuit.Instruction`\ s with  float-only ``params`` as key to query the relation.
    This could lead to incorrect results if the instruction's definition
    depended on additional information beyond just the :attr:`~.circuit.Instruction.params`
    attribute, as, for example, in the case of :class:`.PauliEvolutionGate`.
    This behavior is now fixed, and the commutation checker eagerly caches
    commutations only for Qiskit-native standard gates.
    For custom gates, this change might incur a performance cost; however, guarantees correct
    results by avoiding unsafe caching.

    Fixed a bug in the :class:`.CommutationChecker`, where checking commutation relations of
    an instruction
    with non-numeric values in the :attr:`~.circuit.Instruction.params` attribute (as in the
    case of :class:`.PauliGate`) could raise an error.
    Fixed `#13570 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/13570>`__.
