    A bug has been fixed which had allowed broadcasting when a
    :class:`.PauliList` is initialized from :class:`.Pauli`\ s or labels.  For
    instance, the code ``PauliList(["XXX", "Z"])`` now raises a
    ``ValueError`` rather than constructing the equivalent of
    ``PauliList(["XXX", "ZZZ"])``.
