    The :class:'.StabilizerState' class now has a new method 
    :meth:'~.StabilizerState.probabilities_dict_from_bitstring' allowing the 
    user to pass single bitstring to measure an outcome for. Previouslly the 
    :meth:'~.StabilizerState.probabilities_dict' would be utilized and would 
    at worst case calculate (2^n) number of probability calculations (depending
    on the state), even if a user wanted a single result. With this new method 
    the user can calculate just the single outcome bitstring value a user passes 
    to measure the probability for. As the number of qubits increases, the more 
    prevelant the performance enhancement may be (depending on the state) as only 
    1 bitstring result is measured.
