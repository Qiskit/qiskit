    Fix a bug in the multi-controlled rotation circuit methods `QuantumCircuit.mcrx`, `QuantumCircuit.mcry,
    and `QuantumCircuit.mcrz`, when the user provides an unbounded parameter.
    Previously, the user would have got an error that this gate cannot be synthesized with unbound parameter,
    and now these multi-controlled rotation circuits can be synthesized.
