    Fix a bug in the multi-controlled rotation circuit methods `QuantumCircuit.mcrx`, `QuantumCircuit.mcry,
    and `QuantumCircuit.mcrz`, when the user provides an unbounded parameter, as well as when calling
    `RXGate(theta).control()`, `RYGate(theta).control()` or `RZGate(theta).control()` for some parameter theta.
    Previously, the user got an error that this gate cannot be synthesized with unbound parameter,
    and now these multi-controlled rotation circuits can be synthesized without raising an error.
