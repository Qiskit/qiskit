    When transpiling a circuit with :meth:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.delay`
    instructions, the circuit will be converted to a scheduled circuit. This
    requires that the user supply either a backend with default gate duration
    information, or explicitly supply ``instruction_durations`` as an argument
    to the transpiler.
