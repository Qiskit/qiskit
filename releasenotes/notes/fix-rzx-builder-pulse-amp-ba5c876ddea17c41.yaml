    Fixed a bug in the :class:`.RZXCalibrationBuilder` transpiler pass where
    the scaled cross-resonance pulse amplitude could appear to be parametrized
    even after assignment. This could cause the pulse visualization tools to
    use the parametrized format instead of the expected numeric one.
    See `#8031 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/pull/8031>`__.
