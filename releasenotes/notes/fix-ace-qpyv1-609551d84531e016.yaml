    Fixed a security vulnerability in :func:`.qpy.load` when loading
    payloads that use ``sympy`` to serialize
    :class:`.ParameterExpression` objects and other symbolic expressions.
    This potentially includes any QPY payload using QPY version < 10, and
    optionally 10, 11, and 12 depending on the symbolic encoding used in the
    serialization step (:func:`.qpy.dump`).
