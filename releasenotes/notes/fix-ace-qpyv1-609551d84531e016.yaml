    Qiskit 1.4.2 is a patch release that fixes bugs found in the 1.4 release
    series.
features:
  - |
    Added a new flag ``trust_payload``, to the :func:`.qpy.load` function.
    This is used to force the function to load a payload that is potentially
    insecure. If the payload contains :class:`.ScheduleBlock` objects
    (either standalone or as part of :attr:`.QuantumCircuit.calibrations`)
    and the symbolic encoding in the QPY file is set to ``sympy`` then the
    payload is potentially insecure and loading it could allow for arbitrary
    code execution. Since this flag is for controlling the deserialization
    of :class:`.ScheduleBlock` instances which do not exist in
    Qiskit >= 2.0.0 this flag will only exist in Qiskit 1.4.x and will not
    exist in Qiskit >=2.0.0.

security:
  - |
    Fixed a security vulnerability in :func:`.qpy.load` when loading
    payloads that use ``sympy`` to serialize
    :class:`.ParameterExpression` objects and other symbolic expressions.
    This potentially includes any QPY payload using QPY version < 10, and
    optionally 10, 11, and 12 depending on the symbolic encoding used in the
    serialization step (:func:`.qpy.dump`).
upgrade:
  - |
    By default, :class:`.qpy.load` will now raise a :class:`.QpyError` when
    called with a QPY payload that contains a :class:`.ScheduleBlock` object (either standalone or as part of
    :attr:`.QuantumCircuit.calibrations`) which is using ``sympy`` for encoding
    symbolic expressions. This
    is because the payload is potentially vulnerable and should only be loaded
    if you trust the contents. If you are certain that the payload is not malicious,
    you can set the new ``trust_payload`` argument of :class:`.qpy.load` to
    ``True``, and this will enable loading the payload.
