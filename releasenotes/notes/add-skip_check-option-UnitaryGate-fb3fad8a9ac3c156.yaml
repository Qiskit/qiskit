    Added a new argument, ``check_input``, to the constructor for the
    :class:`~.UnitaryGate` class. This flag is used to disable the default
    initialization checks that input object represents a unitary matrix.
    This can be used to speed up the creation of :class:`~.UnitaryGate`
    objects if you know the input is already a unitary matrix. This new option
    should only be used in these cases because if it's set to ``False`` and
    the input is not unitary this will result in an invalid ``UnitaryGate``
    object.
