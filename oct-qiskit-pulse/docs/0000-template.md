RFC markdown filename should be of the form `####-rfc-title.md`. Where #### will
be set as `max(rfc_####) + 1` after the acceptance of the RFC, but before its
merger. If the RFC requires supporting files, a folder may be created with the
same name as the RFC, `####-rfc-title`, in which the RFC should reside.
