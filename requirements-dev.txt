# Requirements to develop Terra, and the minimum needed to run its CI.  All
# optional requirements should go in `requirements-optionals.txt` instead.
#
# Version requirements here can be more restrictive than elsewhere, because they
# never become actual package requirements, but still try to be as relaxed as
# possible so it's easy to develop multiple packages from the same venv.

# Style
black[jupyter]~=22.0

# Lint
# These versions are pinned precisely because pylint frequently includes new
# on-by-default lint failures in new versions, which breaks our CI.
