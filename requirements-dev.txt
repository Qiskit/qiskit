# Requirements to develop Terra, and the minimum needed to run its CI.  All
# optional requirements should go in `requirements-optionals.txt` instead.
#
# Version requirements here can be more restrictive than elsewhere, because they
# never become actual package requirements, but still try to be as relaxed as
# possible so it's easy to develop multiple packages from the same venv.

# Style
black[jupyter]~=24.1


# Lint
#
# These versions are pinned precisely because pylint frequently includes new
# on-by-default lint failures in new versions, which breaks our CI.

# Documentation tooling.
#
# This alone is not sufficient to fully build the documentation, because several
# components of Qiskit use some of its optional dependencies in order to document
# themselves. These are the requirements that are _only_ required for the docs
# build, and are not used by Qiskit itself.
#
# Be careful when adding new requirements. We want to keep the docs build simple because
# we only build docs in this repo to generate API references that get consumed by
# https://github.com/Qiskit/documentation. For example, coordinate adding dependencies
# like `sphinx-design` to make sure that `Qiskit/documentation` will be able to 
# consume it properly.
