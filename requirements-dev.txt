# Requirements to develop Terra, and the minimum needed to run its CI.  All
# optional requirements should go in `requirements-optionals.txt` instead.
#
# Version requirements here can be more restrictive than elsewhere, because they
# never become actual package requirements, but still try to be as relaxed as
# possible so it's easy to develop multiple packages from the same venv.

# Style
black[jupyter]~=22.0


# Lint
#
# These versions are pinned precisely because pylint frequently includes new
# on-by-default lint failures in new versions, which breaks our CI.

# Documentation tooling.
#
# This alone is not sufficient to fully build the documentation, because several
# components of Terra use some of its optional dependencies in order to document
# themselves.  These are the requirements that are _only_ required for the docs
# build, and are not used by Terra itself.
