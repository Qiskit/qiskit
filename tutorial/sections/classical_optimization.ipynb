    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Many problems in finance and business are optimization problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "Optimization or combinatorial optimization means searching for an optimal solution in a finite or countably infinite set of potential solutions. Optimality is defined with respect to some criterion function, which is to be minimized or maximized. This is typically called the cost function or objective function. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Types of optimization problems**\n",
    "\n",
    "Minimization: cost, distance, length of a traversal, weight, processing time, material, energy consumption, number of objects\n",
    "\n",
    "Maximization: profit, value, output, return, yield, utility, efficiency, capacity, number of objects. \n",
    "\n",
    "The two problems that are consider in this notebook are:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### MaxCut:\n",
    "\n",
    "MaxCut is an NP-Complete problem. MaxCut has applications in clustering, network science, and statistical physics. For example consider the problem of many different people (nodes) and how they can influence (weight) others, and you want to answer the question what is the best marketing strategy to maximize revenue by offering for free the product to one subset of buyers, while determining how to approach the remaining buyers with a particular price.(SHOULD WE ADD THAT APPROXIMATIONS ARE ALSO HARD). \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a $n$-node unidirectional graph *G(V, E)* where *|V| = n* with edge weights $w_{ij}>0$ for $(i, j)\\in E$. A cut is defined as the partitioning into two sets. We define the cost as the sum of weights of edges crossing the cut. By assigning $x_i=0$ or $x_i=1$ to each node $i$ depending on its location to the cut the maximum cut is a cut that maximizes\n",
    "\n",
    "$$C(\\textbf{x}) = \\sum_{i,j} w_{ij} x_i (1-x_j).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "An extension of the MaxCut problem is to let the nodes themselves carry weights, which can be regarded as the nodes having a preference on their location. Doing this the objective function becomes \n",
    "\n",
    "$$C(\\textbf{x}) = \\sum_i w_i x_i + \\sum_{i,j} w_{ij} x_i (1-x_j).$$\n",
    " \n",
    "Mapping this to a Quantum Hamiltonian is trival $x_i\\rightarrow (1-Z_i)/2$ where $Z_i$ is the Pauli Z operator that has eigenvalues $\\pm 1$. Doing this we find that \n",
    "\n",
    "$$C(\\textbf{Z}) = \\sum_i w_i (1-Z_i)/2 + \\sum_{i<j} \\frac{w_{ij}}{2} (1-Z_iZ_j)= \\frac{-1}{2}\\left(\\sum_i w_i Z_i + \\sum_{i<j} w_{ij} Z_iZ_j\\right)+\\mathrm{const},$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where const = $\\sum_i w_i/2 + \\sum_{i<j}w_{ij}/2$. That is the MaxCut is equivalent to minimizing the Ising Hamiltonian \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ H = \\sum_i w_i Z_i + \\sum_{i<j} w_{ij} Z_iZ_j.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Traveling Salesman Problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to being a notorious NP-complete problem that has drawn the attention of computer scientists and mathematician for over two centuries, as the name suggests, the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) has important bearings on finance and marketing. Colloquially, the traveling salesman is one who goes from city to city to sell a merchandise. His/her objective (TSP)  is to find the shortest path that would enable them to visit all the cities and return to their hometown (i.e., the city where he started). This way he/she gets to maximize their potential sales in the least amount of time. \n",
    " \n",
    "The problem derives its importance from its \"hardness\" and ubiquitous equivalence to other relevant combinatorial optimization problems that arise in practice.\n",
    " \n",
    "The mathematical formulation with some early analysis was proposed by W.R. Hamilton in early 19th century. Mathematically the problem is best abstracted in terms of graphs. The TSP on the nodes of a graph asks for the shortest Hamiltonian cycle that can be taken through each of the nodes. A *Hamilton cycle* is a cycle that uses every vertex of a graph once. The general solution is unknown and finding an efficient solution (e.g., a polynomial time algorithm) is expected to not exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Find the shortest Hamiltonian cycle in a graph $G=(V,E)$ with $n=|V|$ nodes and distances, $w_{ij}$ (distance from vertex $i$ to vertex $j$). As in many optimization problems the solution will use $N^2$ variables $x_{i,p}$, where $i$ represents the node and p represents its order in a prospective cycle. The decision variable takes the value 1 if the solution occurs at node $i$ at time order $p$. We require that every node can only appear once in the cycle and for each time a node must occur. This amounts to the two constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sum_i x_{i,p} = 1 ~~\\forall p$$\n",
    "$$\\sum_p x_{i,p} = 1 ~~\\forall i.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For nodes in our prospective ordering, if $x_{i,p}$ and $x_{j,p+1}$ are both 1, then there should be an energy penalty if $(i,j) \\notin E$ (not connected in the graph)\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sum_{(i,j)\\notin E}\\sum_p x_{i,p}x_{j,p+1}>0.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally the objective that needs to be minimized is \n",
    "\n",
    "$$C(\\textbf{x})=\\sum_{(i,j)\\in E}w_{ij}\\sum_p x_{i,p}x_{j,p+1}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Puttling this all together in a single function to be minimized we get the following objective function\n",
    "\n",
    "$$C(\\textbf{x})=B\\sum_{(i,j)\\in E}w_{ij}\\sum_p x_{i,p}x_{j,p+1}+ A\\sum_p\\left(1- \\sum_i x_{i,p}\\right)^2+A\\sum_i\\left(1- \\sum_p x_{i,p}\\right)^2 +A\\sum_{i,j\\notin E}\\sum_p x_{i,p}x_{j,p+1},$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $A$ and $B$ are free parameters. Again mapping this to a quantum problem is trivial and the objective function becomes \n",
    "$$C(\\textbf{z})=\\mathrm{const} + 2(2-n)A \\sum_{i,p} Z_{i,p}- \\frac{A}{4}\\sum_{(i,j)\\notin E,p} Z_{i,p} - \\frac{A}{4}\\sum_{(i,j)\\notin E,p} Z_{j,p+1} - \\frac{B}{4}\\sum_{(i,j)\\in E,p} w_{ij}Z_{i,p} - \\frac{B}{4}\\sum_{(i,j)\\in E,p} w_{ij}Z_{j,p+1}$$\n",
    "$$+ A \\sum_{i,j,p}Z_{i,p}Z_{j,p} + A \\sum_{i,p,q}Z_{i,p}Z_{i,q}+ \\frac{A}{4} \\sum_{(i,j)\\notin E,p}Z_{i,p}Z_{j,p+1}+\\frac{B}{4} \\sum_{(i,j)\\in E,p}w_{ij}Z_{i,p}Z_{j,p+1}. $$\n",

    "\n",
    "This is again equivalent to minimizing a Ising Hamiltonian.\n",

    "### Approximate Universal Quantum Computing for Optimization Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "Recently there has been interest in investigating approximate algorithms for optimization [ADD REFS]. Here we show a slight variation to them which we have been looking at under the general concept of approximate quantum computing.  In general, we don’t expect this to have an exponential speed up, but due to the nature and importance of these problems it is worth investigating heuristic approaches on a quantum computer which could speed up some instances. The hope is that that due to the large space of a quantum computer we can explore the problem by exploiting entanglement to trade exponential calls for quantum depth. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Algorithm works as follows:\n",
    "1. Choose the $w_i$ and $w_{ij}$ in Ising problem (can have higher powers of Z if needed).\n",
    "2. Choose the depth of the quantum circuit (this could be done adaptively).\n",
    "3. Choose a set of controls $\\theta$ and make a trial function $|\\psi(\\theta)\\rangle$.\n",
    "4. Evaluate $C(\\theta) = \\langle\\psi~|H|~\\psi\\rangle = \\sum_i w_i \\langle\\psi~|Z_i|~\\psi\\rangle+ \\sum_{i<j} w_{ij} \\langle\\psi~|Z_iZ_j|~\\psi\\rangle$ by sampling the outcome of the circuit and adding the expectation values together.\n",
    "5. Use a classical optimizer to choose a new set of controls.\n",
    "6. Continue until the $C(\\theta)$ has reach a minimum to determine $\\theta^*$\n",
    "7. Use $\\theta^*$ to generate samples from the distribution $|\\langle z~|\\psi\\rangle|^2$ to obtain the answer.\n",
    "    \n",
    "It is our belief the difficulty of finding good heuristic algorithms will come down to the choice of the trial functions. Do we choose a trial function that has entanglement in a way that best aligns with the problem (as indicated in [REF])? or do we make the amount of entanglement a variable [REF]? These questions are beyond our goals here and we will consider only the simple trial functions \n",
    "\n",
    "$$|\\psi(\\theta)\\rangle  = [U_\\mathrm{single}(\\theta) U_\\mathrm{entangler}]^m |+\\rangle$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $U_\\mathrm{entangler}$ is a function of cPhase gates (fully entangling), and $U_\\mathrm{single}(\\theta) = Y(\\theta)^{\\otimes n}$, where $n$ is the number of qubits and $m$ is the depth of the quantum circuit. The motivation for this choice is that for these classical problems this choice allows us to search over the space of states that have only quantum states with real coefficients and we don’t have to worry about refocusing out all the complex phases but still can exploit the entanglement to search for solutions potential faster (less calls to the objective function).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note a benefit on this over making this is real hardware is we are not limited to the connectivity of the device and it is trivial to map any optimization problems to a virtual Hamiltonian which we sample. Getting higher orders such as $Z_iZ_jZ_k$ is also simple which in real hardware is generally impractical. The noise is mainly due to the gates and if the depth is small enough we can perform this algorithm with high fidelity."
