    "## Introduction\n",
    "Many people tend to think quantum physics is hard math, but this is not actually true. Quantum concepts are very similar to those seen in the linear algebra classes you may have taken as a freshman in college, or even in high school. The challenge of quantum physics is the necessity to accept counter-intuitive ideas, and its lack of a simple underlying theory. We believe that if you can grasp the following two Principles, you have will have a good start: \n",
    "1. [A physical system in a perfectly definite state can still behave randomly.](#section1)\n",
    "2. [Two systems that are too far apart to influence each other can nevertheless behave in ways that, though individually random, are somehow strongly correlated.](#section2)"

    "This time, the results are surprising. Unlike the classical case, with high probability the outcome is not random, but in the $|0\\rangle$ state. *Quantum randomness* is not simply like a classical random coin flip. In both of the above experiments, the system (without noise) is in a definite state, but only in the first case does it behave randomly. This is because, in the first case, via the $H$ gate, we make a uniform superposition of the ground and excited state, $(|0\\rangle+|1\\rangle)/\\sqrt{2}$, but then follow it with a measurement in the computational basis. The act of measurement in the computational basis forces the system to be in either the $|0\\rangle$ state or the $|1\\rangle$ state with an equal probability (due to the uniformity of the superposition). In the second case, we can think of the second $H$ gate as being a part of the final measurement operation; it changes the measurement basis from the computational basis to a *superposition* basis. The following equations illustrate the action of the $H$ gate on the computational basis states:\n",
    "$$H: |0\\rangle  \\rightarrow  |+\\rangle=\\frac{|0\\rangle+|1\\rangle}{\\sqrt{2}}$$\n",
    "$$H: |1\\rangle \\rightarrow |-\\rangle=\\frac{|0\\rangle-|1\\rangle}{\\sqrt{2}}.$$\n",
    "We can redefine this new transformed basis, the superposition basis, as the set {$|+\\rangle$, $|-\\rangle$}. We now have a different way of looking at the second experiment above. The first $H$ gate prepares the system into a superposition state, namely the $|+\\rangle$ state. The second $H$ gate followed by the standard measurement changes it into a measurement in the superposition basis. If the measurement gives 0, we can conclude that the system was in the $|+\\rangle$ state before the second $H$ gate, and if we obtain 1, it means the system was in the $|-\\rangle$ state. In the above experiment we see that the outcome is mainly 0, suggesting that our system was in the $|+\\rangle$ superposition state before the second $H$ gate. \n",

Upon reading the Principle, one might be inclined to think that entanglement is simply strong correlation between two entitities -- but entanglement goes well beyond mere perfect (classical) correlation. If you and I read the same paper, we will have learned the same information. If a third person comes along and reads the same paper they <i>also</i> will have learned this information. All three persons in this case are perfectly correlated, and they will remain correlated even if they are separated from each other. \n",

In the quantum world, you and I could read the same quantum paper, and yet we will not learn what information is actually contained in the paper until we get together and share our information.

Thus, quantum entanglement goes much further than perfect correlation.\n",

The convention we use in the Quantum Experience is to label states by writing the first qubit's name in the rightmost position, thereby allowing us to easily convert from binary to decimal. As a result, we define the tensor product between operators $q_0$ and $q_1$ by $q_1\\otimes q_0$. \n",
