# This file defines the set of people responsible for different sections of the
# Qiskit code.
#
# Being listed as a code owner on a section here means that user is empowered
# to approve and merge pull requests for that section of code. It also comes
# with an expected responsibility to review and maintain those subsections of
# the repository.
#
# The @Qiskit/terra-core team is the group who're responsible for the
# entire qiskit-terra project and are empowered to approve merge code in any
# part of the repository. Any member of the terra-core group should not be
# listed in this file as it's redundant.
#
# A PR can be merged when approved by at least one codeowner. For PRs that touch
# more than one section with non-overlapping codeowners more than one codeowner
# may be required to approve a PR.
#
# However, every contributor to Qiskit can (and should!) review open PRs. This
# file is just about outlining responsibility for maintainership and final
# review/merging of PRs in different subsections of the repository.

# Global rule, unless specialized by a later one
* @Qiskit/terra-core
