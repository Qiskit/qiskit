# A schedule only runs on branches that match include rules from _both_ `main`
# and the branch itself.  On `main`, we blanket include all branches that might
# want to be enabled, then particular branches can override it to exclude
# themselves by removing themselves from the trigger list.  For example, old
# stable branches can remove `stable/*` from their copy of this file once they
# reach their end-of-life.
