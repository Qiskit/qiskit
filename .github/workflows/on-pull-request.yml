  # The preliminary stage should be small in both total runtime (including
  # provisioning) and resources required.  About half of PR commits result in
  # a CI failure, and over 90% of these are in linting, documention or a test
  # failure that would affect _any_ OS or Python version.  The goal in the
  # first stage is to catch the vast majority of failures with minimal cost.

      # A PR is more likely to fail CI because it introduces a logic error

      # dependency that isn't accounted for in the test-skipping logic
      # (and such a failure would need fewer iterations to fix).  We want
      # to fail fast in the first CI stage.

  # The rest of the PR pipeline is to test the oldest and newest supported

  # intermediate version of Python, so we just catch those in the cron-job
  # pipeline to reduce the amount of resources used.
