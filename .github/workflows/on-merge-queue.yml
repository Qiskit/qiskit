# Merge queue.  A PR that reaches here has already passed the more rigorous PR
# suite, so is very likely to pass.  The main reasons for failures here are
# flaky VMs timing out (which we can't do much about), or a merge conflict
# with another PR that is also in the merge queue.
#
# There's no reason to have multiple stages in this case, because we're
# expecting it to pass.  Having more than one stage frustrates parallel
# throughput in low-contention cases, and guarantees a longer critical path.
