"""
Example showing how to use Qiskit at level 1 (intermediate).

This example shows how an intermediate user interacts with Terra.
It builds some circuits and transpiles them with transpile options.
It then makes a qobj object which is just a container to be run on a backend.
The same qobj can be submitted to many backends (as shown).
It is the user's responsibility to make sure it can be run (i.e. it conforms
to the restrictions of the backend, if any).
This is useful when you want to compare the same
circuit on different backends without recompiling the whole circuit,
or just want to change some runtime parameters.

To control the passes that transform the circuit, we have a pass manager
for the level 2 user.
