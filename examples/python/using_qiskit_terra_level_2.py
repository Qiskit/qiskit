Example showing how to use Qiskit at level 2 (advanced).

The order of the passes can determine the best way for a circuit to be complied. Here we
make a simple circuit of 4 repeated CNOTs and show that the default pass is not as good
as making a pass manager and telling it to start with CXCancellation.
