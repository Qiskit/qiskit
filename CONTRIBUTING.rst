Contributing
============

**We appreciate all kinds of help, so thank you!** 

You can contribute in many ways to this project.

Issue reporting
---------------

This is a good point to start, when you find a problem please add
it to the `issue traker <https://github.com/QISKit/qiskit-sdk-py/issues>`_.
The ideal report should include the steps to reproduce it.

Doubts solving
--------------

To help less advanced users is another wonderful way to start. You can
help us to close some opened issues.  This kind of tickets should be
labeled as ``question``.

Improvement proposal
--------------------

If you have an idea for a new feature please open a ticket labeled as
``enhancement``. If you could also add a piece of code with the idea
or a partial implementation it would be awesome.

Documentation
-------------

The documentation for the project is in the ``doc`` directory. The
documentation for the python SDK is auto-generated from python
docstrings using `Sphinx <www.sphinx-doc.org>`_ for generating the
documentation. Please follow `Google's Python Style
Guide <https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html?showone=Comments#Comments>`_
for docstrings. A good example of the style can also be found with
`sphinx's napolean converter
documentation <http://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html>`_.
To generate the documenatation run

.. code:: sh

					make doc

Code
----

This section include some tips that will help you to push source code.

Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Needed libraries should be installed in this way:

.. code:: sh

    # Depending on the system and setup to append "sudo -H" before could be needed.
    pip3 install -r requirements-dev.txt

Test
~~~~

New features often imply changes in the existent tests or new ones are
needed. Once they're updated/added run this be sure they keep passing:

.. code:: sh

					make test

Style guide
~~~~~~~~~~~

Submit clean code and please make effort to follow existing conventions
in order to keep it as readable as possible. We use
`Pylint <https://www.pylint.org>`_ and `PEP
8 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008>`_ style guide, to confirm
the new stuff respects it run the next command:

.. code:: sh

					make lint

Good first contributions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You are welcome to contribute wherever in the code you want to, of course, but
we recommend taking a look at the "Good first contribution" label into the issues and
pick one. We would love to mentor you!

Doc
~~~

Review the parts of the documentation regarding the new changes and
update it if it's needed.

Pull requests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We use `GitHub pull requests
<https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests>`_ to accept the
contributions. You can explain yourself as much as you want. Please
follow the next rules for the commit messages:

   white space. Followed by one or more descriptive paragraphs, each
   separated by one line of white space. All of them finished by a dot.
-  If it fixes an issue, it should include a reference to the issue ID
   in the first line of the commit.
-  It should provide enough information for a reviewer to understand the
   changes and their relation to the rest of the code.
