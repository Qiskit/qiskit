/// A leaf holding one value, or a branch of ordered children.
///
/// Constructing a tree parses `object`: a `list` or `tuple` becomes a branch of unnamed children,
/// a `dict` becomes a branch named by its keys in insertion order, and a namedtuple becomes a
/// branch named by its fields. Anything else is a leaf, unless it defines `__datatree__()`, which
/// is called to obtain the tree to use in its place. A tree holds no record of which container a
/// name or a position came from.
///
/// A child is addressed by its name or by its position, and any value below it by a dotted path of
/// the two. Reading a child gives the value of a leaf, or a `DataTree` over a subtree::
///
///     tree = DataTree({"counts": [3, 4], "ev": 0.1})
///     tree["ev"]         # 0.1
///     tree["counts"]     # DataTree([3, 4])
///     tree["counts"][1]  # 4
///     tree["counts.1"]   # 4, the same value by one path
///     tree[-1]           # 0.1
///
/// Length, iteration and `in` cover the children of a branch, of which a leaf has none: its value
/// is read through `leaf`, with `is_leaf` to ask first. A branch names all of its children or none
/// of them, and `is_mapping` says which. One that names them has a mapping form, described by
/// `keys()`, `values()` and `items()`, so `dict(tree)` and `**tree` work. Those three raise on a
/// branch that has none.
