//! The quantum program: the dataflow IR that Qiskit's `BackendV3` interface consumes.
//!
//! A program describes a hybrid quantum-classical computation as typed tensor values produced and
//! consumed by instructions. It is inert data: it describes a computation without performing one.
//!
//! - [`tensor`] is the value domain. A [`Tensor`](tensor::Tensor) is a dense array over one of a
//!   fixed set of dtypes, and a [`TensorType`](tensor::TensorType) is its data-less counterpart.
//! - [`ops`] holds the [`ProgramOp`] contract and the ops Qiskit defines. The set is open: an
//!   op may be defined outside this crate, in its own namespace.
//! - [`program`] holds [`QuantumProgram`], a whole computation, and the [`ProgramFunction`]s it is
//!   made of, each of which is one dataflow graph. Instructions are the only entity a function
//!   holds: a [`Value`] is an output slot of the instruction producing it, and a function's
//!   parameters and results are instructions too, so every value has a producer.
//! - [`data_tree`] holds [`DataTree`], the container for structured values. A program's inputs and
//!   outputs arrive in one, arranged by the structures it declares, which is where all naming lives.
