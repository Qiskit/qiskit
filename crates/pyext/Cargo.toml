[features]
# We always need to activate PyO3's `extension-module` for this crate to be useful at all, but we
# need it *not* to be active for the tests of other crates to work.  If the feature is active,
# `libpython` is *not* linked, and if the feature isn't present, then it is.  To test the Rust
# crates as standalone binaries, executables, we need `libpython` to be linked in, so we make the
# feature a default, and run `cargo test --no-default-features` to turn it off.
