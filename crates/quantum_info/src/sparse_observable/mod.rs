/// This is just the Rust-space representation.  We make a separate Python-space `enum.IntEnum` to
/// represent the same information, since we enforce strongly typed interactions in Rust, including
/// not allowing the stored values to be outside the valid `BitTerm`s, but doing so in Python would
/// make it very difficult to use the class efficiently with Numpy array views.  We attach this
/// sister class of `BitTerm` to `SparseObservable` as a scoped class.
///
/// # Representation
///
/// The `u8` representation and the exact numerical values of these are part of the public API.  The
/// low two bits are the symplectic Pauli representation of the required measurement basis with Z in
/// the Lsb0 and X in the Lsb1 (e.g. X and its eigenstate projectors all have their two low bits as
/// `0b10`).  The high two bits are `00` for the operator, `10` for the projector to the positive
/// eigenstate, and `01` for the projector to the negative eigenstate.
///
/// The `0b00_00` representation thus ends up being the natural representation of the `I` operator,
/// but this is never stored, and is not named in the enumeration.
///
/// This operator does not store phase terms of $-i$.  `BitTerm::Y` has `(1, 1)` as its `(z, x)`
/// representation, and represents exactly the Pauli Y operator; any additional phase is stored only
/// in a corresponding coefficient.
///
/// # Dev notes
///
/// This type is required to be `u8`, but it's a subtype of `u8` because not all `u8` are valid
/// `BitTerm`s.  For interop with Python space, we accept Numpy arrays of `u8` to represent this,
/// which we transmute into slices of `BitTerm`, after checking that all the values are correct (or
/// skipping the check if Python space promises that it upheld the checks).
///
/// We deliberately _don't_ impl `numpy::Element` for `BitTerm` (which would let us accept and
/// return `PyArray1<BitTerm>` at Python-space boundaries) so that it's clear when we're doing
/// the transmute, and we have to be explicit about the safety of that.

/// The allowed alphabet forms an overcomplete basis of the operator space.  This means that there
/// is not a unique summation to represent a given observable.  By comparison,
/// :class:`.SparsePauliOp` uses a precise basis of the operator space, so (after combining terms of
/// the same Pauli string, removing zeros, and sorting the terms to :ref:`some canonical order
/// <sparse-observable-canonical-order>`) there is only one representation of any operator.
///
/// :class:`SparseObservable` uses its particular overcomplete basis with the aim of making
/// "efficiency of measurement" equivalent to "efficiency of representation".  For example, the
/// observable :math:`{\lvert0\rangle\langle0\rvert}^{\otimes n}` can be efficiently measured on
/// hardware with simple :math:`Z` measurements, but can only be represented by
/// :class:`.SparsePauliOp` as :math:`{(I + Z)}^{\otimes n}/2^n`, which requires :math:`2^n` stored
/// terms.  :class:`SparseObservable` requires only a single term to store this.
///
/// The downside to this is that it is impractical to take an arbitrary matrix or
/// :class:`.SparsePauliOp` and find the *best* :class:`SparseObservable` representation.  You
/// typically will want to construct a :class:`SparseObservable` directly, rather than trying to
/// decompose into one.
///
///
/// Representation
/// ==============
///
/// The internal representation of a :class:`SparseObservable` stores only the non-identity qubit
/// operators.  This makes it significantly more efficient to represent observables such as
/// :math:`\sum_{n\in \text{qubits}} Z^{(n)}`; :class:`SparseObservable` requires an amount of
/// memory linear in the total number of qubits, while :class:`.SparsePauliOp` scales quadratically.
///
/// The terms are stored compressed, similar in spirit to the compressed sparse row format of sparse
/// matrices.  In this analogy, the terms of the sum are the "rows", and the qubit terms are the
/// "columns", where an absent entry represents the identity rather than a zero.  More explicitly,
/// the representation is made up of four contiguous arrays:

///
/// .. _sparse-observable-canonical-order:
///
/// Canonical ordering
/// ------------------
///
/// For any given mathematical observable, there are several ways of representing it with
/// :class:`SparseObservable`.  For example, the same set of single-bit terms and their
/// corresponding indices might appear multiple times in the observable.  Mathematically, this is
/// equivalent to having only a single term with all the coefficients summed.  Similarly, the terms
/// of the sum in a :class:`SparseObservable` can be in any order while representing the same
/// observable, since addition is commutative (although while floating-point addition is not
/// associative, :class:`SparseObservable` makes no guarantees about the summation order).
///
/// These two categories of representation degeneracy can cause the ``==`` operator to claim that
/// two observables are not equal, despite representating the same object.  In these cases, it can
/// be convenient to define some *canonical form*, which allows observables to be compared
/// structurally.
///
/// You can put a :class:`SparseObservable` in canonical form by using the :meth:`simplify` method.
/// The precise ordering of terms in canonical ordering is not specified, and may change between
/// versions of Qiskit.  Within the same version of Qiskit, however, you can compare two observables
/// structurally by comparing their simplified forms.
///
/// .. note::
///
///     If you wish to account for floating-point tolerance in the comparison, it is safest to use
///     a recipe such as::
///
///         def equivalent(left, right, tol):
///             return (left - right).simplify(tol) == SparseObservable.zero(left.num_qubits)
///
/// .. note::
///
///     The canonical form produced by :meth:`simplify` alone will not universally detect all
///     observables that are equivalent due to the over-complete basis alphabet. To obtain a
///     unique expression, you can first represent the observable using Pauli terms only by
///     calling :meth:`as_paulis`, followed by :meth:`simplify`. Note that the projector
///     expansion (e.g. ``+`` into ``I`` and ``X``) is not computationally feasible at scale.
///
/// Indexing
/// --------
///
/// :class:`SparseObservable` behaves as `a Python sequence
/// <https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-sequence>`__ (the standard form, not the expanded

/// Conversions
/// ===========
///
/// An existing :class:`SparseObservable` can be converted into other :mod:`~qiskit.quantum_info`
/// operators or generic formats.  Beware that other objects may not be able to represent the same
/// observable as efficiently as :class:`SparseObservable`, including potentially needed
/// exponentially more memory.

///   ===========================  =================================================================
///   Method                       Summary
///   ===========================  =================================================================
///   :meth:`as_paulis`            Create a new :class:`SparseObservable`, expanding in terms
///                                of Pauli operators only.
///
///   :meth:`to_sparse_list`       Express the observable in a sparse list format with elements
///                                ``(bit_terms, indices, coeff)``.
///   ===========================  =================================================================
///
/// In addition, :meth:`.SparsePauliOp.from_sparse_observable` is available for conversion from this
/// class to :class:`.SparsePauliOp`.  Beware that this method suffers from the same
/// exponential-memory usage concerns as :meth:`as_paulis`.
///
/// Mathematical manipulation
/// =========================
///
/// :class:`SparseObservable` supports the standard set of Python mathematical operators like other
/// :mod:`~qiskit.quantum_info` operators.
///
/// In basic arithmetic, you can:
///
/// * add two observables using ``+``
/// * subtract two observables using ``-``
/// * multiply or divide by an :class:`int`, :class:`float` or :class:`complex` using ``*`` and ``/``
/// * negate all the coefficients in an observable with unary ``-``
///
/// Each of the basic binary arithmetic operators has a corresponding specialized in-place method,
/// which mutates the left-hand side in-place.  Using these is typically more efficient than the
/// infix operators, especially for building an observable in a loop.
///
/// The tensor product is calculated with :meth:`tensor` (for standard, juxtaposition ordering of
/// Pauli labels) or :meth:`expand` (for the reverse order).  The ``^`` operator is overloaded to be
/// equivalent to :meth:`tensor`.
///
/// .. note::
///
///     When using the binary operators ``^`` (:meth:`tensor`) and ``&`` (:meth:`compose`), beware
///     that `Python's operator-precedence rules
///     <https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#operator-precedence>`__ may cause the
///     evaluation order to be different to your expectation.  In particular, the operator ``+``
///     binds more tightly than ``^`` or ``&``, just like ``*`` binds more tightly than ``+``.
///
///     When using the operators in mixed expressions, it is safest to use parentheses to group the
///     operands of tensor products.
///
/// A :class:`SparseObservable` has a well-defined :meth:`adjoint`.  The notions of scalar complex
/// conjugation (:meth:`conjugate`) and real-value transposition (:meth:`transpose`) are defined
/// analogously to the matrix representation of other Pauli operators in Qiskit.
///
///
/// Efficiency notes
/// ----------------
///
/// Internally, :class:`SparseObservable` is in-place mutable, including using over-allocating
/// growable vectors for extending the number of terms.  This means that the cost of appending to an
/// observable using ``+=`` is amortised linear in the total number of terms added, rather than
/// the quadratic complexity that the binary ``+`` would require.
///
/// Additions and subtractions are implemented by a term-stacking operation; there is no automatic
/// "simplification" (summing of like terms), because the majority of additions to build up an
/// observable generate only a small number of duplications, and like-term detection has additional
/// costs.  If this does not fit your use cases, you can either periodically call :meth:`simplify`,
/// or discuss further APIs with us for better building of observables.
