/// These are internally stored in units of `rad / pi`.  Explicitly, in conjunction with the `exp(-i
/// P angle / 2)` conventions of Pauli rotations, this means, for example:
///
/// * a stored value `1.0` is equivalent (up to phase) of an application of the Pauli.
/// * a stored value `4.0` is a _complete_ Pauli rotation (including phase)
/// * a stored value `0.25` is a T-like rotation.
///
/// The internal storage of [`f64`] makes integer multiples of binary fractions exact, and IEEE-754
/// requires the basic arithmetic operations to produce the float nearest to the "true" mathematical
/// answer.  Together, these mean that the Clifford rotations (and T rotations) are stored exactly,
/// and simple arithmetic on them is exact.  This is not the case with raw radians, which incur
/// round-off error due to the irrational `pi`.
