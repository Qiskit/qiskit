/// A qid has two components:
///
/// * a "memory space" identifier ([`space`](Self::space));
/// * an integer that marks unique qids within a given memory space ([`value`](Self::value)).
///
/// The memory-space component takes one of the values enumerated by [`QidSpace`].  The semantics of
/// the particular quantum resource in MIR differs based on the memory space its qid is part of, but
/// the [quantum semantics](#quantum-semantics) are always the same.
///
///
/// # Quantum semantics
///
/// The main purpose of [`Qid`] is to define restrictions on the use of quantum resources.  You can
/// use [`Qid`] to model any resource you like that follows these semantics.  The two rules are:
///
/// - qids are neither defined nor consumed by MIR instructions, they are mutated;
/// - no MIR instruction can refer to two qids that "overlap".
///
/// The first rule is enforced in the type system by the structure of MIR instructions.  The second
/// rule is checked by the verification logic; it is an error for a complete MIR transformation to
/// leave reachable instructions in place that violate the overlap rules.
