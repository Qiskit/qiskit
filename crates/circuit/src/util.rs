use num_complex::Complex64;

// This is a very conservative version of an abbreviation for constructing new Complex64.
// A couple of alternatives to this function are
// `c64<T: Into<f64>, V: Into<f64>>(re: T, im: V) -> Complex64`
// Disadvantages are:
//  1. Some people don't like that this allows things like `c64(1, 0)`. Presumably,
//     they prefer a more explicit construction.
//  2. This will not work in `const` and `static` constructs.
// Another alternative is
//   macro_rules! c64 {
//       ($re: expr, $im: expr $(,)*) => {
//           Complex64::new($re as f64, $im as f64)
//       };
// Advantages: This allows things like `c64!(1, 2.0)`, including in
// `static` and `const` constructs.
//  Disadvantages:
//  1. Three characters `c64!` rather than two `c64`.
//  2. Some people prefer the opposite of the advantages, i.e. more explicitness.
/// Create a new [`Complex<f64>`]
