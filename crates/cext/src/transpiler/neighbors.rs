/// # Representation
///
/// After initialization by `qk_neighbors_from_target`, the structure will be in one of two modes:
///
/// * all-to-all connectivity
/// * limited two-qubit connectivity
///
/// In the all-to-all case, the `neighbors` and `partition` pointers will both be the null pointer,
/// and `num_qubits` will be the number of qubits in the `QkTarget`.  These objects do not have
/// backing allocations, and do not need to be given to `qk_neighbors_clear` (though this function
/// is a safe no-op in this case).
///
/// In the limited two-qubit case (which is by far the more common for real hardware), see the
/// documentation of the structure members for their interpretation.
