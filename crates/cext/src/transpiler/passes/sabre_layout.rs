/// @ingroup QkTranspilerPasses
/// Run the SabreLayout transpiler pass on a circuit.
///
/// The SabreLayout pass chooses a layout via an iterative bidirectional routing of the input
/// circuit.
///
/// Starting with a random initial Layout, the algorithm does a full routing of the circuit to end up with a final_layout.
/// This final_layout is then used as the initial_layout for routing the reverse circuit. The algorithm iterates a number
/// of times until it finds an initial_layout that reduces full routing cost.
///
/// This method exploits the reversibility of quantum circuits, and tries to include global circuit information in the
/// choice of initial_layout.
///
/// This pass will run both layout and routing and will transform the circuit so that the layout is applied to the input
/// (meaning that the output circuit will have ancilla qubits allocated for unused qubits on the coupling map and the
/// qubits will be reordered to match the mapped physical qubits) and then routing will be applied. This is done because
/// the pass will run parallel seed trials with different random seeds for selecting the random initial layout and then
/// selecting the routed output which results in the least number of swap gates needed. This final
/// swap calculation is the same as performing a final routing, so it's more efficient to apply it
/// after computing it.
///
/// This function is multithreaded and will launch a thread pool with threads equal to the number
/// of CPUs by default. You can tune the number of threads with the ``RAYON_NUM_THREADS``
/// environment variable. For example, setting ``RAYON_NUM_THREADS=4`` would limit the thread pool
/// to 4 threads.
