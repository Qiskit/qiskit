/// @ingroup QkCircuitLibrary
/// Generate a Quantum Volume model circuit
///
/// The model circuits are random instances of circuits used to measure the Quantum Volume
/// metric, as introduced in [1]. The model circuits consist of layers of Haar random
/// elements of SU(4) applied between corresponding pairs of qubits in a random bipartition.
///
/// This function is multithreaded and will launch a thread pool with threads equal to the
/// number of CPUs by default. You can tune the number of threads with the
/// RAYON_NUM_THREADS environment variable. For example, setting RAYON_NUM_THREADS=4 would
/// limit the thread pool to 4 threads.

///     Phys. Rev. A 100, 032328 (2019). [arXiv:1811.12926](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12926)
///
/// # Parameters
///
/// - `num_qubits`: The number qubits to use for the generated circuit.
/// - `depth`: The number of layers for the generated circuit.
/// - `seed`: An RNG seed used for generating the random SU(4) matrices used
///   in the output circuit. If the provided number is negative the seed used
///   will be soured from system entropy.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```c
///     QkCircuit *qc = qk_circuit_library_quantum_volume(10, 10, -1)
/// ```
