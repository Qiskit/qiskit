/// Trait that declares how a Rust-native object exposes "owned" versions of itself to the C API.
///
/// # Implementing
///
/// You typically don't need to implement this by hand; use the [`expose_by_box!`] or
/// [`expose_by_arc!`] macros to do it for you.  Since the trait is unsafe to implement, these two
/// macros require you to wrap them in `unsafe` blocks to work.  You do this like
/// ```no_run
/// # #[macro_use] extern crate qiskit_cext;
/// struct MyType;
/// // SAFETY: `MyType` is always exposed and freed by `Box`.
/// const _: () = unsafe { expose_by_box!(MyType) };
///
/// #[unsafe(no_mangle)]
/// pub extern "C" fn qk_mytype_new() -> *mut MyType {
///     MyType.into_leaked()
/// }
/// #[unsafe(no_mangle)]
/// pub unsafe extern "C" fn qk_mytype_free(ptr: *mut MyType) {
///     _ = (!ptr.is_null()).then(|| unsafe { MyType::steal(ptr) })
/// }
/// ```
///
/// # Safety
///
/// By implementing this trait, you are asserting that every time an object passes ownership to C,
/// it uses the same smart-pointer type.  If you have a `qk_*_*free` method, this almost certainly
/// holds.
///
/// The [`Owner`] type needs to be able to leak itself to a single thin pointer, and then recreate
/// itself entirely from the same pointer. [`Box`] and [`Arc`] both satisfy this.

    /// [`Arc`].

    ///

    /// outstanding valid reference, where the pointer was produced by [`Self::leak`] (or
    /// equivalent).
