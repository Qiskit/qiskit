# jsonschema pinning needed due nbformat==5.1.3 using deprecated behaviour in
# 4.0+. The pin can be removed after nbformat is updated.
jsonschema==3.2.0

# Numpy 1.25 deprecated some behaviours that we used, and caused the isometry
# tests to flake. See https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/10305,
# remove pin when resolving that.

# Scipy 1.11 seems to have caused an instability in the Weyl coordinates
# eigensystem code for one of the test cases.  See
# https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/10345 for current details.
scipy<1.11

# cvxpy 1.4.0 caused an instability in some diamond-norm tests.  That's
# likely to be an unreliable measure already given its nature, so this
# pin may be relaxed by modifying the tests slightly to choose known-safe
# operators.
cvxpy==1.3.2
