# jsonschema pinning needed due nbformat==5.1.3 using deprecated behaviour in
# 4.0+. The pin can be removed after nbformat is updated.
jsonschema==3.2.0

# pyparsing restrictions are needed because pyparsing 3.0.0 and 3.0.1 break
# matplotlib's mathtex extensions.  At the time of writing (2021-10-25), the
# docs build is pinned to matplotlib<3.4 (current) because of deprecations, so
# as we won't get matplotlib upgrades by default, this constraint likely can't
# be removed until we can unpin matplotlib.
pyparsing<3.0.0

# Jinja2 3.1.0 is incompatible with sphinx and/or jupyter until they are updated
# to work with the new jinja version (the jinja maintainers aren't going to
# fix things) pin to the previous working version.
jinja2==3.0.3

# setuptools 64.0.0 breaks editable installs. Pin to an old version until
# see https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues/3498
setuptools==63.3.0
