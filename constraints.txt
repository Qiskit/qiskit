# z3-solver from 4.12.3 onwards upped the minimum macOS API version for its
# wheels to 11.7. The Azure VM images contain pre-built CPythons, of which at
# least CPython 3.8 was compiled for an older macOS, so does not match a
# `macos_11_7` platform tag.  This should be purely a CI artefact, and not
# affect local usage.
z3-solver==4.12.2.0; platform_system=="Darwin"

# There are minor differences in output between pydot 2 and pydot 3 for
# things like the pass-manager drawer.  This is totally fine for general
# usage, but our test suite uses an exact reference file that uses the
# pydot 3 output, so we need to enforce that during tests.
pydot>=3.0.0
