# z3-solver from 4.12.3 onwards upped the minimum macOS API version for its
# wheels to 11.7. The Azure VM images contain pre-built CPythons, of which at
# least CPython 3.8 was compiled for an older macOS, so does not match a
# `macos_11_7` platform tag.  This should be purely a CI artefact, and not
# affect local usage.
